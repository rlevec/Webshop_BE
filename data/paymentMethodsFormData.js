        <h4>
            1. Payment upon receipt of shipment (cash on delivery)</h4>
        <br/>
        <p>
            If you decide to pay when you pick up the shipment, you must pay for the products only when you pick
            them up. You are obliged to pay the invoice for the ordered product to the delivery person upon
            delivery
            of the ordered product. Payment to the delivery person is possible only in cash and cards.</p>
        <br/>
        <h4>2. Payment via direct bank transaction (payment by general order/order)</h4>
        <br/>
        <p>The option of payment by direct bank transaction enables payment via internet banking, mobile
            banking, in
            a bank, post office, and the like. By choosing this option when ordering the product, the customer
            will
            receive the data necessary for making the payment to his e-mail address. The delivery process begins
            when we register the payment in our system.</p>
        <br/>
        <h4>
            3. Payment by cards</h4>
        <p>
            When paying with credit and debit cards, payment authorization is done automatically. CydexPharm
            bears
            all manipulative costs of authorizing the user's credit/debit card. In case of unsuccessful payment
            authorization, the purchase process is interrupted. The customer is responsible for the correctness
            of
            the data provided using the webshop service.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The payment is considered to have been made at the moment the money is collected by the courier
            service,
            at the moment the payment is recorded in our system or at the moment the authorization is received
            by
            the card issuer.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The agreed purchase price includes VAT and is expressed in euros. Please note that the means of
            payment
            in the Republic of Croatia is the euro, and the customer pays the cost of currency conversion.</p>
