            functionality
            of the product.</p>

        <p>In order for the consumer to determine the nature, characteristics and functionality of the goods, he
            can

            as well as those that would reduce the value of the goods.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            In the event of a decrease in the value of the product as a result of handling the product, the
            seller
            will be charged from the amount of the purchase price received in the proportion of the decrease in
            the
