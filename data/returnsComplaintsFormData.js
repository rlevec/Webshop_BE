        <p>
            The customer is obliged to return the product that he returns to the CydexPharm pharmacy complete,
            in
            the condition in which it was delivered and in the original packaging (commercial packaging in which
            the
            goods were delivered), with all associated parts and documentation. The customer is obliged to
            return
            the products at his own expense to the address from which they were delivered. The consumer can find

        <p>
            We pack the products in such a way that they cannot be damaged during normal transportation. When
            picking up the product from the delivery service, the customer is obliged to check for possible
            damages
            and immediately report them to the delivery service, that is, to the worker who delivered the goods,
            and
            refuse to pick up the shipment with visible external damage.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            If the damage is not visible from the outside, and part or all of the contents of the package is
            damaged
            or broken, it is necessary to take the following photos:</p>
        <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Photo of the outer packaging</li>
            <li>Photo of the inner packaging (filling and item and package inside)</li>
            <li>Photo of the damaged/broken contents of the package</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Photos must be sent within <strong>2 days</strong> after receiving the damaged package to the e-mail
            address <a
            href={"mailto:rene.levec@outlook.com"}>rene.levec@outlook.com</a> together with a description of the
            damage and the order number.</p>
