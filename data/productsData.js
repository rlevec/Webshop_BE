The combination of collagen, hyaluronic acid and resveratrol nourishes the skin from the inside, and vitamin C contributes to the normal formation of collagen for normal skin function and contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress . Aging reduces the body's ability to produce collagen and hyaluronic acid, which leads to a decrease in the elasticity and suppleness of the skin and ultimately results in the disappearance of wrinkles.",

By taking the product, additional introduction of collagen and hyaluronic acid into the body is ensured. It has been clinically proven that taking 5 g of Naticol hydrolyzed marine collagen for eight weeks reduces the appearance of wrinkles and improves skin tightness. The liquid form of collagen ensures faster absorption and greater utilization, which contributes to the beauty of your skin in the long term."

The combination of collagen, hyaluronic acid and vitamin B complex nourishes the skin from the inside, and vitamin C contributes to the normal formation of collagen for the normal function of the skin and contributes to the protection of cells from oxidative stress. Aging reduces the body's ability to produce collagen and hyaluronic acid, which leads to a decrease in the elasticity and suppleness of the skin and ultimately results in the disappearance of wrinkles.",

By taking the product, additional introduction of collagen and hyaluronic acid into the body is ensured. It has been clinically proven that taking 10 g of Naticol hydrolyzed marine collagen for six weeks reduces the appearance of wrinkles and improves skin tightness. A combination of ingredients that ensures faster renewal of your skin, protects cells from oxidative stress, reduces wrinkles and restores a youthful appearance. The liquid form of collagen ensures faster absorption and greater utilization, which contributes to the beauty of your skin in the long term."
