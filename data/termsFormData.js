                        obligations, all in accordance with the provisions of the Law on Obligations according to the
                        consumer's

                        The buyer can terminate the contract only if he has previously given the seller a subsequent
                        appropriate
                        term for the fulfillment of the contract. If the defect is insignificant, the buyer has no right to
                        terminate the contract, but he has other rights from liability for material defects, including the
                        right
                        to repair the damage.</p>

                        The buyer can terminate the contract even without leaving a subsequent deadline if the seller, after
                        notifying him of the defects, has informed him that he will not fulfill the contract or if it is
                        obvious
                        from the circumstances of the specific case that the seller will not be able to fulfill the contract
                        even in the subsequent deadline, as well as in the case when the buyer, due to the seller's delay,
                        does
                        not can achieve the purpose for which he concluded the contract.

                    <p>

                        If the seller does not fulfill the contract in the subsequent period, it is terminated according to
                        the
                        law itself, but the buyer can keep it if he declares to the seller without delay that he keeps the
                        contract in force.
