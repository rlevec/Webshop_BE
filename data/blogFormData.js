the child receives all important nutrients from the mother. It is clear that many nutrients are of particular importance in this delicate period, however, as studies reveal, attention is most often placed on the intake of folic acid, iron and calcium.
The result is poor knowledge of pregnant and breastfeeding women about other necessary vitamins and minerals, as well as omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for a healthy 
pregnancy and proper development of the child.</p><p>In addition, analyzes show that pregnant women consume about 100 - 120 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) per day for a typical 
Westerner, which is twice less than the recommended intake. The current situation points to the importance of educating and raising awareness among pregnant and lactating women 
about the increased need for important vitamins and minerals and omega-3 fatty acids.</p><h1>Why are omegas important to us during pregnancy?</h1><p>Omega-3 fatty acids are 
polyunsaturated fatty acids that are necessary for development and health, and the human body cannot synthesize them by itself, but must consume them through food. The most 
important omega-3 fatty acids are EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid).</p><p>Both fatty acids are found together in food and while EPA is important for 
heart health and anti-inflammatory response, DHA is extremely important for the development and health of the brain, vision and central nervous system, which is why it is 
necessary for a healthy pregnancy outcome.</p><p>Insufficient intake of omega-3 fatty acids in the pre- and postnatal period can lead to less brain mass, impaired visual 
function, malformation of neural structures in the child, and increase the risk of hearing loss and faster brain aging in old age.</p><p>It is believed that the role 
of DHA in the development of the nervous system is the reason why insufficient intake leads to irreversible negative changes in the child's neurological development.</p><p>Namely, 
the last 3 months of pregnancy and the first few years of life are crucial for proper brain development. When a newborn is born, his body mass is only 5% of the body mass of adults, 
but that is why the size of the brain is 70% of the size of the adult brain. DHA, especially in the last months of pregnancy, is concentrated in the brain and on the retinal membrane, 
especially on the photoreceptors, which is why it is important that the mother consumes enough omega-3 fatty acids.
</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/moms_babies/nutrients_pregnancy.jpg" alt="nutrients-pregancy"/><p>However, 
pregnancy is not the only period when omega-3 fatty acids can be important, since the child's brain continues to develop years after birth. 
The remaining growth of the brain takes place during the first year of life and preschool age, so brain growth is mostly completed by the fifth 
or sixth year of life. Therefore, it is crucial that the nursing mother ensures a sufficient intake of omega-3 fatty acids (especially DHA), 
as she will transfer these important fatty acids to her child through milk.</p><h1>A word of science</h1><p>Thanks to numerous studies that have shown 
the benefit of omega-3 fatty acid intake, especially DHA, it is believed that the intake of preparations that provide these substances during pregnancy 
and breastfeeding can have a favorable effect on development in general, and especially on the cognitive development of the child. Thus, at the end of the 
last century and at the beginning of this century, studies found a positive connection between higher intake of DHA (prenatally in the mother and/or 
postnatally in the child) and better cognitive performance, specifically greater ability to solve problems and ability to concentrate. More recent studies 
are on a similar track.</p><p>For example, a study published in 2014 in the journal Child Development studied the impact of maternal DHA intake on the cognitive 
development of children up to the age of 22 months. The authors of the study used questionnaires to examine the eating habits and intake of fish oil preparations 
in 125 healthy pregnant women on two occasions during pregnancy. After birth, cognitive development was examined with tests at the age of 6 weeks and 22 months.
</p><h4 class="root-paragraph">After birth, it was shown that children whose mothers consumed fish oil had significantly better hand-eye coordination compared 
to the placebo group. The authors of the study concluded that the intake of fish oil during pregnancy is a safe way of providing the child with the necessary 
DHA and that it can have a positive effect on the cognitive development of the little one.</h4><p>Mothers also provided information on the length of 
breastfeeding in a questionnaire. The results showed that children whose mothers had the highest intake of DHA achieved better results in tests of 
cognitive abilities at the age of 22 months compared to children whose mothers had a low intake of DHA. Interestingly, a positive effect was shown 
only for DHA intake in the last trimester, indicating that this period is critical for the cognitive development of the child.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/moms_babies/omega_3_pregnancy.jpg" alt="omega-3-pregnancy"/><p>The third trimester is a period of intense utilization of DHA by the fetal brain, which continues even after birth. Therefore, scientists believe that a high intake of DHA in the mother in the child, among other things, increases myelination, which enables faster processing of information during cognitive tests.</p><p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study published in 2008 in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood provided additional rationale for taking omega-3 fatty acid supplements during pregnancy. 98 pregnant women received either fish oil (2.2 g DHA+1.1 g EPA) or placebo (olive oil) from the 20th week of pregnancy until delivery.<p/><p>Bearing in mind the importance of the intake of omega-3 fatty acids, competent institutions in the USA and Europe recommend a daily intake of at least 250, and preferably 300 mg of omega-3 (DHA + EPA), to pregnant and lactating women, while the proportion of DHA should be 200 mg as would achieve a beneficial effect, i.e. contribute to the normal development of the brain and eyes of fetuses and breastfed infants.</p><p>Since during pregnancy and breastfeeding, the diet often does not contain enough omega-3 fatty acids from their best source - blue fish, most often due to the fear of the potential intake of toxic mercury, dietary supplements become a practical and concentrated source of these important fats.</p></div>`

alt="moms_babies_immunity_of_pregnant_and_lactating_women"/><p>During pregnancy and breastfeeding, there is an increased need for certain nutrients that are of 
great importance for the proper growth and development of the fetus, but also for the health of pregnant and breastfeeding women, and for their immunity. 
In addition to a balanced diet, enough rest and sleep, moderate exercise, attention should also be paid to several nutrients important for the proper functioning 
of the immune system.</p><h3>Vitamin D</h3><p>In addition to the importance of vitamin D for the long-term reduction of the risk of bone fractures and osteoporotic 
changes in offspring, its importance for the proper functioning of the immune, nervous, endocrine and cardiovascular systems has been observed. The recommended daily intake for pregnant and lactating women according to the latest guidelines is 800 IU.</p><h3>Zinc</h3><p>Lack of zinc can result in premature birth, cause reduced growth and disorders of psychomotor development, and can affect the immune response by reducing the development of T lymphocytes. In addition to being beneficial for maintaining immunity, zinc supplementation has been shown to reduce the incidence of diarrhea in children between 6-13 months of age. The recommended daily intake for pregnant women is 11 mg, and for lactating women 12 mg.</p><h3>Iron<h3/><p>Iron contributes to the reduction of fatigue and exhaustion, normal formation of red blood cells and hemoglobin, normal oxygen transport in the body, normal cognitive function and normal function of the immune system. This mineral is extremely important, therefore it is necessary to determine its concentration in the blood and, in agreement with the gynecologist, to see whether its supplementation through prenatal formulas and nutritional supplements is sufficient, or whether the addition of iron registered as a medicine is also necessary. The recommended daily intake of iron is 14 mg.</p><h4>
In addition to a balanced diet, enough rest and sleep, moderate exercise, attention should also be paid to several nutrients important for the proper functioning 
of the immune system.</h4><h3>Omega-3</h3><p>Of the eight omega-3 fatty acids included in the diet, the most important are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic 
acid (DHA). Although EPA and DHA can be synthesized in the body from ALA (alpha linolenic acid), the synthesis is slow and requires a whole series of cofactors. 
This synthesis is negligible in newborns and is completely dependent on the intake of these fatty acids through the mother's diet. In developed countries, 
insufficient intake of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet of all population groups has been recorded, mostly due to the small amount of blue fish in the diet. 
Omega 3 fatty acids, in addition to having an anti-inflammatory effect, increase the child's psychomotor abilities, reduce the possibility of developing 
hyperactivity, reduce the development of postnatal depression and affect the immune responses involved in allergic reactions in children. It is desirable 
to consume a minimum of 200 mg of DHA and 80 mg of EPA per day.</p><h3>Probiotics</h3><p>In addition to having a favorable effect on the mother's immunity, 
probiotics will reduce the incidence of allergic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in children. Recommended 
strains are Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 and Bifidobacterium BB-12.</p><h3>Royal Jelly</h3><p>Royal jelly is the most 
valuable bee product. It is the secretion of the pharyngeal glands of young worker bees, which is secreted in the period from 5 to 15. days of life, 
and is produced from brought flower powder, nectar and water. It has antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic and anti-inflammatory effects and affects 
the regulation of the immune system. Royal jelly also has a gonadotropic effect - it works excellently in achieving and maintaining pregnancy and lactation.</p></div>`

It is caused by the action of the male sex hormone. Hair thins first on the sideburns and crown, and gradually hair loss can occur on the entire scalp. Treatment should begin at the first signs of this condition. There are preparations that can reduce the influence of male sex hormones on shortening the hair growth cycle and improve the circulation of hair follicles. These are the following:</p><img src="5_preparations_that_can_reduce_baldness_in_men_22" alt="five_preparations_that_can_reduce_baldness_in_men_alt"/><ul><li>Topical minoxidil can increase blood flow to the follicle. It is most effective to apply 1 ml of a 5% solution twice a day. During the first months of treatment, there may be an increase in hair loss, which is transient, and hair growth can be noticed only after 6-9 months of use. Treatment continues as long as there are positive results.</li><li>
Aminexil is a molecule chemically similar to minoxidil and clinically proven to be effective in male pattern baldness. It comes in the form of ampoules that are applied once a day to dry or wet scalp and do not leave the hair greasy.</li><li>
Neoptide MEN lotion contains a combination of ingredients that stimulate blood circulation and help supply the elements necessary for cellular metabolism. It is easy to use and does not make hair greasy.</li><li>
Stimulating shampoos against hair loss contain substances that increase the density of hair and keep it healthy</li><li>Micronutrients, vitamins and minerals play an important role in the normal development of hair follicles. Their addition can improve the nutrition of the hair and thus prevent further hair loss.</li></ul><p>
If the application of these preparations does not improve within 6 months, it is necessary to contact a dermatologist in order to apply another therapy.</p><img src="five_preparations_that_can_reduce_baldness_in_men_alt_alt" alt="five_preparations_that_can_reduce_baldness_in_men_alt_alt"/></div>`

Alzheimer's disease is a severe, incurable, degenerative disease of the brain that, as it progresses, causes severe dementia, memory loss and poor understanding, as well as changes in the patient's thinking and behavior.</p><p>It occurs most often and affects the population over 65 years of age, destroying healthy tissue in the brain where more and more abnormal brain cells are created. Over time, more and more brain cells die and the patient's condition worsens, eventually leading to death.</p><p>In addition to the fact that it occurs in the elderly, there is a high probability that the disease appears genetically (familial) and that women are mostly affected by it. On average, the life expectancy of a patient after confirmation of the diagnosis is 7 years.</p><p>Although the exact cause of the disease is still not clear, it is assumed that the cause of the disease is the accumulation of certain proteins in the brain (beta-amyloids and tau proteins), due to which accumulation leads to the loss of neurons that produce the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and the spread of the disease eventually affects the entire brain. It is important to emphasize that the disease itself causes the patient to experience cognitive disturbances and psychological changes over time that impair the patient's independence.</p><h1>
Establishing a diagnosis</h1><p>The diagnosis of the disease is made on the basis of the clinical picture, by discussing data from the family history and with the help of cognitive testing. It is very important to exclude other diseases whose symptoms such as dementia or cognitive impairment may coincide with the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. It is necessary to rule out metabolic endocrinological changes in the body, therefore it is important to perform tests on the level of vitamin B12 and thyroid hormones.</p><p>It is necessary to perform imaging tests of the brain such as magnetic resonance imaging, and with today's technological advancement, new sophisticated methods of confirming the diagnosis are also available in Croatia, such as the determination of biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture and brain imaging with PET CT.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/elderly/how_to_live_with_alzheimers_disease_alt.jpeg" alt="how_to_live_with_alzheimers_disease_alt"/><h1>
Clinical picture and symptoms of the disease</h1><p>We can monitor the progress of Alzheimer's disease in patients through 3 stages: mild, moderate and advanced Alzheimer's. The symptoms of the disease appear gradually and vary from person to person and vary in intensity with age.</p><p>The first symptom that occurs most often is the loss of short-term memory with good preservation of long-term memory. Patients begin to forget recent events, which is often mistakenly attributed to normal aging. Cognitive symptoms of the disease appear gradually, most often by forgetting recent events, frequently asking the same questions, confusing things, and the like.</p><p>As the disease progresses, patients begin to lose their memory and sense of time and space (they forget certain dates such as the date of birth, what day it is, what time it is, they cannot orientate themselves in space), problems with speech and writing appear.</p><p>In the later stages of the disease, patients often do not even recognize people close to them and it is difficult for them to maintain normal verbal communication. Mental changes that patients show already at the beginning of the disease are manifested by changes in mood and loss of interest in hobbies that they used to enjoy. As the disease progresses, mood changes are more frequent and sometimes lead to inappropriate social behaviors such as agitation, aggression, irritability, jealousy, wandering, anxiety, depression...</p><p>Relatives of the patient often decide to hospitalize the patient after the mentioned or similar episodes or have to devote themselves completely to the patient due to the impossibility of performing basic life functions (maintaining personal hygiene, dressing, controlling urination, managing finances...). Patients eventually lose all brain functions and are unable to sleep normally, get out of bed, move or swallow food.</p><h4>Delirium is very common in people with dementia. Delirium is an acute, transient, reversible condition characterized by attention deficit, altered state of consciousness, distraction, and disorganized behavior, and it is important to distinguish the symptoms of delirium from dementia. Thus, among other things, the onset of delirium is sudden with a clear moment of onset, while dementia develops gradually.</h4><h1>
Treatment of diseases</h1><p>
Although the disease is incurable, there are drugs that can slow the progression of the disease. The best treatment results can be achieved by treating symptoms and providing support to patients and their families.</p><p>
The effect of drugs is best when the disease is detected at an early stage, and the first choice of drugs is antidementia. Antidementia drugs affect the maintenance of patients' intellectual abilities as long as possible, and the use of drugs improves the transmission of information between nerve cells-neurons. There are two groups of drugs that differ in their mechanism of action and work best in combination, namely:</p><ul><li>
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors compensate for the lack of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and are used in the early and middle stages of the disease. In Croatia, donepezil and rivastigmine are registered in this group of drugs</li><li>
NMDA receptor blockers (N-methyl-D-aspartate - an amino acid derivative that mimics the action of glutamate, i.e. a neurotransmitter that normally acts on the receptor) - this group of drugs is represented by mementin, which is most often used in the middle and late stages of treatment and regulates the function of glutamate, which in pathological states of nerve cell destruction</li></ul><p>It is important for patients to start using therapy as early as possible in the earliest stages of the disease, and it is necessary to ensure the necessary support in the form of psychotherapy and a calm and cheerful environment that helps them maintain their daily routine of life. It is also very important to consume food supplements that help preserve concentration and memory, such as ginkgo biloba, magnesium, fish oil, guarana, soy lecithin, but also vitamins of the B complex and tensilen.</p><h1>
Alzheimer's in Croatia</h1><p>According to the latest data from the Croatian Institute of Public Health, about 3,000 new cases of the disease appear in Croatia every year, while the total number of patients is about 85,000. Croatia is one of the world's oldest populations, and it is necessary to take care of people with</p><p>
Since 2012, the Croatian Society for Alzheimer's Disease and Elderly Psychiatry has been operating in the Republic of Croatia as a professional society of the Croatian Association of Pharmacists. The Croatian Association for Alzheimer's disease has been active since 1999, advocating the rights of patients and their caregivers, warning of the growing problem of dementia and emphasizing the need for improvement in medical care for patients.</p><p>
In 2014, the Croatian Alzheimer's Alliance was founded, which is made up of 26 associations and societies, all with the aim of raising awareness of the disease itself and the needs of sufferers.</p><p>As part of the Service for Mental Health and Addiction Prevention at the Institute for Public Health Dr. Andrija Štampar (Mirogojska 16), there is also a Center for the Protection of the Mental Health of the Elderly, which includes the prevention and protection of the mental health of the elderly and the early detection of all psychological disorders, including different types of dementia. Below you can find the contact numbers and addresses of the Center for all your inquiries:</p><ul><li>Remetinečki gaj 14 (01/ 383 00 88), Ožegovićeva 9 (01/ 641 40 30</li></ul><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/elderly/how_to_live_with_alzheimers_disease_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="how_to_live_with_alzheimers_disease_alt_alt"/><h1>Disease prevention and tips for improving communication with patients</h1><p>A large number of studies have been conducted in the world that confirm that the consumption of certain foods can contribute to the prevention of the onset of diseases, and these are, first of all, fresh fruits and vegetables, from which it is important to single out those that contain anthocyanins; active substances antioxidants that are proven to improve memory and reduce the level of free radicals in the body - blueberries. Here are some tips that can help prevent the disease:</p><ul><li>
consumption of leafy green vegetables such as cabbage, kale, broccoli and spinach which are sources of folic acid as well as yeast and offal</li><li>consumption of salmon, tuna or sardines as fish that contain good essential fatty acids</li><li>consumption of whole grains, white meat such as chicken and turkey and a very low intake of red meat</li><li>avoiding smoking and alcohol</li><li>
maintenance of normal body weight and control of blood cholesterol and blood pressure</li><li>
daily physical activity for at least 30 minutes a day</li><li>
stimulating mental abilities by reading, solving tasks and crossword puzzles, and by as much and as diverse social activity as possible, that is, socializing with people.</li></ul><p>
Because of the changes in behavior and psychiatric symptoms that occur during the progression of the disease, we may not know how to communicate with sufferers, but we can learn by following some of the guidelines below:</p><ul><li>encourage patients to continue doing activities they can do independently and helping them with what they can no longer do independently (eg dressing, bathing, feeding...)</li><li>
listen to them while respecting their opinions and attitudes and give them time, be realistic, honest and patient and do not rush them in carrying out their daily activities</li><li>if necessary, use visual signs to direct patients' attention to performing certain activities, and in communication and explanation, always try to use the simplest questions or sentences</li><li>
the reality of the patient is very different from our reality; patients live in their own world and in their own beliefs, so it is important not to try to convince the patient of some logical facts, but the exact opposite; try to understand him and enter into their reality and not convince him that he is wrong</li><li>
undesirable behaviors such as aggression or being lost are part of the disease but not of the patient's personality and every sick person tries to live their life in the best possible way with the resources they have left</li><li>
the recommendation in communication with patients is to remember the good old days and memories, ask general questions related to the patient's interests and their past, preserve a good sense of humor - laugh and together validate their life stories, experience and values</li><li>
finally the most important thing; NEVER DISCUSS, CRITICIZE, OR CORRECT people with Alzheimer's disease, but rather divert their thoughts and attention, change the topic of conversation, the environment or decide to go for a pleasant walk in the fresh air</li></ul><p>
Alzheimer's Day is celebrated every year on September 21 in honor of patients and their families.</p></div>`,

Every day we should work to "engage" the brain in activities; in addition to solving crosswords, reading, solving puzzles... Regular physical activity and a healthy lifestyle also have a positive effect on concentration and memory.</h4><p>
Ginko (Ginkgo biloba) is certainly the most important plant in the service of preserving mental health and memory. It is considered a living fossil and dates back to the age of the dinosaurs. Today, ginkgo can be found all over the world, and it is a plant of traditional Chinese medicine.</p><p>
There are many indications for the use of this plant; it is used for the prevention of altitude sickness, for cerebral vascular insufficiency (or popularly speaking "for circulation"), cognitive disorders, dementia, memory loss, glaucoma, for sexual dysfunction as a vasodilator (expands blood vessels).</p><p>
It is used as a standardized plant extract and the most important components are terpene lactones (gincolides and diterpenes) and flavone glycosides (ginkgetin and bilobetin), which have vasoactive and antioxidant properties, thus achieving a protective effect on brain functions.</p><p>Although most people believe that herbs and herbal preparations are completely safe, like drugs and herbs they have their contraindications and side effects. Ginkgo works on several neurotransmitter pathways in the brain, such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. For this very reason, taking ginkgo along with medications such as antidepressants can lead to serotonin syndrome, the symptoms of which are agitation, restlessness, confusion, sweating... As the plant itself has an effect on blood thinning, ginkgo should not be taken by people who are on anticoagulant therapy. Furthermore, as with most herbal medicines, ginkgo should not be taken by pregnant or lactating women.</p><p>
The usual dosage of ginkgo is 60-240 mg/day, and it needs to be taken for at least 2 months to see an effect, with up to 6 months recommended. Due to better absorption, it is preferable to take it with a meal or after a meal.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/elderly/preservation_of_cognitive_abilities_and_brain_functions_in_the_elderly_alt.jpeg" alt="preservation_of_cognitive_abilities_and_brain_functions_in_the_elderly_alt"/><p>
Omega 3 fatty acids include alpha-linolenic (ALA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acid. ALA is primarily found in plant foods and it is the precursor of EPA and DHA, which are mainly found in foods of animal origin (for example, in salmon).</p><p>Omega 3 fatty acids have numerous positive effects on the body. EPA is converted in the body into signaling molecules called eicosanoids, which have an anti-inflammatory effect. According to recent research, EPA and DHA can reduce symptoms of depression, with EPA having a more significant effect.</p><p>
DHA plays a very significant role in the development of the brain and brain functions in childhood, as well as in the maintenance of brain function in adults. It also lowers triglyceride levels, which is essential for maintaining heart function, and can help with diabetes, arthritis and high blood pressure.</p><p>
The recommended ratio of EPA:DHA in dietary supplements is 3:2, which usually corresponds to a dose of 360 mg EPA and 240 mg DHA.</p><p>Omega 3 and omega 3-6-9 preparations can be found in pharmacies. Although it is often believed that "more is better", unless your doctor recommends otherwise, choose an omega 3 supplement. Most people get enough omega 6 fatty acids from their diet, and too much omega 6 can raise blood pressure. Omega 9, unlike omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids, are not essential fatty acids, which means that the body can produce them on its own.</p></div>`,

Sciatica (lat. ischialgia, lumboischialgia) is the name used to describe intense pain that spreads along the sciatic nerve, i.e. from the lower back over the hips or buttocks down the leg. The pain sometimes spreads all the way to the toes, and is usually unilateral.</p><h1>Cause</h1><p>
Sciatica is most often caused by the disc pressing on part of the nerve. The disc slips out (prolapses) from its usual position and compresses the nerve roots, most often in the pelvis and gluteal region. Less often, pressure can be caused by bone irregularities, fractures, aneurysms (widening of arteries) or tumors or abscesses (accumulation of extracellular fluid).</p><p>
Intervertebral disc prolapse most often occurs in middle age as a result of trauma (falling, bending over, lifting weights). Diabetics are a risk group for the development of sciatica because a long-term increase in blood sugar levels damages the nerves.</p><h1>
Symptoms and diagnosis</h1><p>When the sciatic nerve is pressed, there are motor (muscle weakness, weaker movement control, damage to certain reflexes) and sensory (numbness in the leg, pain) symptoms. The pain is typically burning, tearing or stabbing, with or without low back pain. The pain may worsen when sitting and making sudden movements, while walking and lying down usually relieve the sensation of pain.</p><p>In the lying position, raising the straightened sick, and sometimes healthy leg, causes a flow of pain through the leg, which is the so-called Lasègue's test performed by doctors for the purpose of diagnosis. Sensation, strength and reflexes are checked and, if the symptoms persist for more than 6 weeks, X-rays of the pelvis and hips, magnetic resonance and CT are performed.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/elderly/sciatica_alt.jpeg" alt="sciatica_alt"/><h1>Treatmant</h1><p>Treatment depends on the cause and the length and intensity of the symptoms. Milder cases of shorter acute pain can be relieved by lying down for 24-48 hours (longer lying down is not recommended) with the headboard raised by about 30°. After that, it is necessary to gradually return to daily activities, while avoiding positions and movements that aggravate the pain.</p><p>
In addition, cold and warm compresses, local analgesic gels and oral analgesics such as paracetamol or NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, ketoprofen...) help. Medicines against neuropathic pain and physical therapy (exercise and massage) can also help. Exercise is started as soon as the pain subsides, and doctors and physiotherapists most often recommend exercises to stretch the back and strengthen the abdominal and back muscles, as well as exercises in the pool.</p><p>
Surgery is the solution recommended for people in whom pressure on a nerve has caused advanced muscle weakness in the legs, inability to control the bladder and bowels, or excruciating pain that disrupts work and functioning, and even 6 weeks of other therapeutic methods have not led to improvement.</p><h4>
Sciatica is the name used to describe intense pain that extends from the lower back over the hips or buttocks down the leg. It most often occurs due to the pressure of the disc on part of the nerve, and with rest, it is treated with analgesics, cold and warm compresses, physical therapy and, in more severe cases, surgery.</h4><h1>
Self-help</h1><p>In order to prevent or recover from sciatica, it is necessary to reduce the pressure on the sciatic nerve. Therefore, for example, it is not recommended to twist your back sideways or bend it when lifting a heavy load, but keep it upright, and transfer the load to your legs through a squat.</p><p>
Also, it is not recommended to carry heavy bags on only one shoulder. A quality mattress, normal body weight, physical activity, sitting with a straight back and comfortable shoes with a slightly elevated heel are some of the remaining measures.</p></div>`,

Correct blood pressure measurement is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis, proper treatment and monitoring of the effectiveness of therapy for high blood pressure. It is a simple and quick procedure that provides important and useful information.</h4><ul><li>
The measurement is best done in the morning (6-9 a.m.) and in the evening (6-9 p.m.) before taking medication and eating. It is recommended not to take caffeine, alcohol or tobacco products at least half an hour before the measurement.</li><li>
Before the measurement, it is necessary to sit in a quiet room for 3-5 minutes and not talk before and during the measurement.</li><li>
During the measurement, it is necessary to sit in a comfortable position, lean your back against the backrest, lay your legs down calmly, touching the floor with your full feet without crossing your upper legs or ankles.</li><li>Before measuring, it is necessary to remove tight clothing from the upper arm, because the cuff is not placed over thick clothing. If the sleeve is too tight, it does not rise because the crumpled sleeve on the upper arm puts additional pressure on the blood vessels, hinders the correct placement of the cuff and the correct blood pressure reading.</li><li>It is necessary to use the correct cuff (armband) size and place it around the upper arm without tightening it too tightly, so much so that a fingertip can be placed under it. The lower edge of the cuff should be 2.5 cm above the elbow. On some cuffs, the artery mark must lie over the artery that runs down the inside of the arm. This is why it is important to follow the instructions for use before starting to use any type of blood pressure monitor.</li><li>
The hand must be placed at the level of the heart, relaxed, propped on the table or supported by someone else. The one whose blood pressure is being measured must not hold his arm by himself, as this raises blood pressure values.</li><li>
At each measurement, blood pressure is measured twice with an interval of one minute and the average of the two measurements is taken.</li></ul><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/elderly/seven_tips_for_correct_blood_pressure_measurement_alt.jpeg" alt="seven_tips_for_correct_blood_pressure_measurement_alt"/><p>
At the end of the measurement, the values ​​of the upper systolic and lower diastolic pressure and the measured pulse are displayed on the sphygmomanometer screens. It is recommended that the measured values ​​be recorded first systolic, then diastolic and then the pulse (eg 120/80mmHg, 70 beats/min) so that doctors can get correctly recorded pressure values. Tables for documenting blood pressure values ​​are available in our pharmacies and are included in all sphygmomanometer packages.</p></div>`,

It most often begins with the release of a few drops of urine under effort, which is why people begin to avoid certain activities (especially sports). Over time, this discomfort can lead to a person's complete withdrawal from all forms of social activities. Since incontinence is largely a curable health problem, read below about the most common causes of incontinence as well as tips on how to prevent or better control it.</p><h1>
What causes incontinence in the elderly?</h1><p>The problem of urinary incontinence in older age is more common in women than in men. An additional risk of developing urinary incontinence in the elderly is represented by:</p><ul><li>
limited mobility</li><li>
frequent bladder infections</li><li>therapy with certain drugs</li><li>neurological damage</li><li>
frequent problems with constipation (constipation)</li></ul><p>
The development of incontinence is favored by a combination of the previously described risk factors, as well as physiological changes at the level of the urinary system that come with age. With age, the capacity of the urinary bladder and the rate of urine flow decrease, and the frequency of involuntary contractions of the smooth muscles of the bladder wall increases. Also, in women, the length of the urethra decreases, and in men, the volume of the prostate increases.</p><h1>
The three most common types of urinary incontinence and how to recognize them</h1><ul><li>
Stress incontinence – It is the most common form of urinary incontinence in the elderly. It is the result of the weakening of the pelvic floor muscle function. It is recognized by the fact that the leakage of urine usually occurs during exertion, for example during exercise, coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting heavy objects. They are most often the result of difficult or numerous births, long-term cough (eg chronic bronchitis) and obesity. In women, it can also be associated with a lack of estrogen after menopause.</li><li>Urge incontinence - It is most often the result of inadequate control of urination by the central nervous system. It is characterized by a sudden and sudden need to urinate that the person cannot suppress and often cannot hold urine until they reach the toilet. People usually go to urinate often, but in small amounts and with a strong stream. The causes can be numerous: prostate hypertrophy, estrogen deficiency, kidney stones, neurological damage, depression, etc.</li><li>
Overflow incontinence - It is the result of a reduced urge to urinate, due to which urine is released only when the bladder is already full. In this type of incontinence, urine flows out almost continuously, in small quantities and with a weak stream. In men, it is often the result of prostate hypertrophy. Also, it occurs more often in people who are taking certain drugs (eg sedatives or certain types of antidepressants) in their therapy.</li></ul><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/elderly/urinary_incontinence_in_elderly_people_alt.jpeg" alt="urinary_incontinence_in_elderlyP_people_alt"/><p>
It is very often the case that a person has symptoms associated with several forms of urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence is also possible in the elderly who have normal bladder function, but the leakage of urine occurs due to difficulty in reaching the toilet in time (for example, in people with arthritis).</p><h4>
In many cases, urinary incontinence can be prevented or very well controlled. That's why it's important to talk about things like this with your family doctor, gynecologist or pharmacist.</h4><h1>
Tips for better control and prevention of incontinence</h1><p>
There are many ways you can help yourself or your loved ones fight or prevent incontinence.</p><ul><li>
Carrying out regular systematic examinations and open communication with the doctor. Early recognition of incontinence problems is the main prerequisite for successful symptom control.</li><li>
Regular physical activity and pelvic muscle training. Every person, regardless of age, is capable of some form of physical activity. Daily exercise of the pelvic muscles helps in prevention, but is also an essential part of incontinence therapy. The exercises are very quick and easy to learn, and if performed correctly, the results will be visible in a relatively short time.</li><li>Use hygiene aids adapted to your level of incontinence. Talking about the use of pads or diapers often causes discomfort for people with incontinence, but they greatly reduce the restrictions and nervousness associated with carrying out daily social activities.</li><li>
Do not avoid drinking water to prevent urine leakage. Reduced water intake can further reduce bladder capacity and worsen incontinence. Also, insufficient fluid intake can lead to constipation, which also adversely affects the symptoms of incontinence.</li><li>
Avoid drinks that contain caffeine or alcohol. Such drinks have a diuretic effect, i.e. they increase urination, which can aggravate the symptoms of incontinence.</li><li>
Quit or at least cut down on smoking. The risk of developing incontinence is higher in smokers due to the fact that the so-called "chronic smoker's cough" which, like any other form of cough, puts strain on the pelvic muscles.</li><li>
Seek the advice of a doctor or pharmacist if you suffer from constipation. Strong straining during bowel movements strains and weakens the pelvic muscles, which can further aggravate problems with urinary incontinence.</li></ul></div>`

Insight into blood pressure values ​​makes it easier for doctors to make decisions about the start and method of treatment and monitoring the effectiveness of the given therapy. For this reason, blood pressure measurement should be carried out in the correct way, using verified and successfully validated blood pressure monitors recommended by independent international societies. In this text, find out what these blood pressure gauges are.</p><p>Devices for the upper arm have an advantage in measurement compared to devices for the wrist due to higher measurement accuracy. For excessively obese people (body mass index > 45), no standard cuff (armband) for the upper arm is sufficient, so in these cases wrist blood pressure monitors can be used. The Omron sphygmomanometer RS7 Intelli IT is clinically validated for the obese population.</p><p>The correct size and shape of the cuff is crucial for accurate blood pressure measurement. Therefore, before choosing a blood pressure monitor for the upper arm, it is necessary to measure the circumference of the upper arm. Omron has developed sphygmomanometers with a smart cuff (Omron M3, M6 Comfort, M7 Intelli IT) which enables accurate measurement results even when the cuff is incorrectly placed. Such a cuff corresponds to the size of the circumference of the upper arm 22-42 cm. Microlife sphygmomanometers have a cuff and arm movement indicator that reduces the possibility of incorrect measurements and results, and the given cuff size also corresponds to an upper arm circumference of 22-42 cm. If the circumference of the upper arm does not correspond to the specified sizes, it is necessary to additionally take a suitable, larger or smaller, cuff.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/elderly/what_blood_pressure_monitor_to_choose_alt.jpeg" alt="what_blood_pressure_monitor_to_choose_alt"/><p>Associations for hypertension recommend at least two consecutive blood pressure measurements and taking the average value, so Microlife has patented MAM technology that performs three consecutive measurements and gives an average value of these measurements, which provides the highest precision of blood pressure control. Microlife blood pressure monitors BP A3 Plus, BP A150 AFIB, BP B3 AFIB and BP A6 PC have such technology. Also, the Omron M7 sphygmomanometer and M6 Comfort have the option of 3 consecutive measurements to make the measurement more accurate.</p><p>Certain sphygmomanometers have the ability to detect irregular heart rhythm and atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Microlife sphygmomanometers BP A1 Easy, BP A2 Classic, BP A3 Plus and B3 AFIB have an irregular heart rhythm indicator, while Microlife sphygmomanometers BP A150, B3 AFIB, A6 can detect potential atrial fibrillation through AFIB technology. Namely, this does not establish a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, but provides information with which it is necessary to contact the doctor to undertake other tests. Omron M6 Comfort and M7 also have an AFIB function to detect atrial fibrillation, while all other Omron blood pressure monitors have an irregular heart rhythm detector.</p><p>Some blood pressure monitors offer the possibility of transferring data to computers or smart devices, which facilitates the monitoring of health conditions. Such sphygmomanometers are Omron M7 Intelli IT and Microlife BP A6 PC.</p><p>It is recommended that sphygmomanometers are regularly maintained and calibrated once a year. All Microlife sphygmomanometers are clinically tested and adapted for special groups of patients: pregnant women, diabetics, people with renal insufficiency and hypotension (low blood pressure), while Omron M3 Comfort, M6 Comfort and M7 are additionally clinically validated for pregnant women and diabetics.</p></div>`,

<p>Obesity is a growing problem in the modern world, unfortunately not only among adults but also among children. According 
to research, Croatia ranks fourth in Europe in terms of the number of obese children. About 10 percent of school children in 
Croatia are overweight, and 3.8 percent are obese. It is important to distinguish overweight from obesity.</p><p>
The term overweight means the number of kilograms that is slightly above normal values ​​(body mass index 25 to 29.9 kg/m2), 
while obesity means a higher degree of obesity (body mass index over 30 kg/m2).</p><p>
Obesity is caused by excessive food intake compared to the body's needs and insufficient exercise. Sitting in front of
 the TV or computer has largely replaced playing in the park. Genetics play a big role as well as learned wrong behavior patterns.</p><p>
Children who are withdrawn and closed sometimes look for comfort in food, and for some it is also a reaction to stressful 
events. Obesity can also occur with some diseases, such as impaired functioning of the pancreas, thyroid or adrenal glands.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/nutrition/obesity_in_children_alt.jpeg" alt="obesity_in_children_alt"/><p>Proper and balanced nutrition is important for a child's growth and emotional and social development. Obesity can occur already in infancy, and that is why it is important to start adopting proper eating habits as soon as possible. Preschool children must adopt regular meals and gradually enrich the menu with new foods. It is best to serve them small meals 5-6 times a day, given their small stomach capacity and variable appetite. During this period, the child needs to provide 1500 to 1800 calories per day, through foods from all groups (cereals, meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruit and dairy products).</p><p>
Carbohydrates should make up 45-65% of daily energy intake (whole grains, rice, potatoes), proteins 15-20% (meat, fish, eggs, cereals) and fats 30% (of which 10% polyunsaturated fatty acids).</p><h4>
School children need about 2,000 calories per day, depending on the child's activities. Lunch should be the most abundant meal of the day, accounting for about 35% of daily energy intake, breakfast and dinner about 20%, and snack 15%.</h4><p>EARLY MORNING - a sandwich with wholemeal bread, butter, ham and a leaf of lettuce with a cup of yogurt</p><p>BREAKFAST - sliced banana with cereal and milk</p><p>LUNCH - cod with tomato sauce, sweet potatoes and arugula</p><p>SNACK - a cup of chocolate milk with a piece of apple strudel</p><p>DINNER - egg omelette with graham cracker, tomato and pear</p><p>
A few good habits that you can use to help your child regulate body weight:</p><h1>
Increase the physical activity of the whole family</h1><p>
Don't look at a child's obesity as just his problem, but change the lifestyle of the whole family. Plan outdoor activities, instead of watching TV decide to ride a bike, rollerblade, play sports, the possibilities are really great.</p><h1>
Teach the whole family healthy eating habits</h1><p>
Replace sweetened juices with herbal tea or water, snacks and cakes with nuts and fruits, fill the fridge with healthy foods and you've already made a big difference. Try to have meals together and involve the child in food preparation.</p><h1>Do not allow meals in front of the TV</h1><p>
Eating and watching TV at the same time interferes with the process of recognizing satiety and easily leads to overeating.</p><h1>
Do not use food as a reward/punishment</h1><p>
Food must not become an object of trade.</p><h1>Be a child's support and a good example</h1><p>
Children often think of themselves the way their parents think of them. Accepting its weight will also make it feel good, loved and satisfied with itself.</p></div>`

On the contrary, the goal of healthy weight loss is to achieve a good feeling, vitality, additional energy and strengthening of health. Most often, this seems like a complex and difficult to achieve goal, but a correct and balanced diet along with physical activity is the key to success. We can achieve healthy weight loss if we follow the rules of a healthy diet: it is important to know that it is not only important what we eat, but also how we eat; therefore, it is important to adopt healthy eating habits.</p><p>A healthy diet should be seen as a series of small steps that will lead us to the goal, and not as a drastic change that will disrupt our life rhythm. We need to start applying healthy changes gradually, one after another, little by little, but decisively. There are some basic rules that must be followed so that the result is not missing:</p><h1>
A varied diet</h1><p>People often think that a healthy diet is absolute avoidance of a certain type of food. The truth is exactly the opposite - one should be moderate but keep all five basic groups of food substances, namely: proteins (proteins), carbohydrates (sugars), lipids (fats), vitamins and minerals, the intake of which must be balanced and adapted to the individual condition and to the person's needs. Without them, we damage our health.</p><p>
Fruits and vegetables form the basis of a healthy diet because they have few calories and high nutritional value (a lot of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants...). Every meal should contain fruits or vegetables.</p><h1>
Intake of a certain amount of food substances</h1><p>
Sufficient intake of food substances that must correspond to the age, build and current needs of the organism.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/nutrition/healthy_weight_loss_alt.jpeg" alt="healthy_weight_loss_alt"/><h1>
Simplify your life</h1><p>
Instead of worrying about the number of calories we consume and the size of the portion, we should look at food through the spectrum of colors, variety, and freshness - this will make it easier to choose healthier food. Sticking to the food we love, supplementing it with fresh and nutritious ingredients. Gradually, our diet will become healthier, but also tastier.</p><h1>
Go slow and take your time</h1><p>
Trying to change your eating habits overnight is not realistic and usually leads to disappointment because the strict regimen you set for yourself fails to be maintained. Instead, take small steps such as adding a colorful salad to your lunch or replacing refined oil with unrefined olive oil. When that small change becomes a habit, start a new change.</p><h1>Do not forbid yourself certain foods</h1><p>
When you eliminate a certain food completely from the menu, it's natural to start wanting it even more. If you reach for these foods (which you probably will) you will feel disappointed. If you are attracted to sweet, salty or unhealthy food, instead of eliminating it, you should start by reducing the portions and consuming that food less often. With time and a smaller intake - the need for that type of food will decrease by itself.</p><h4>
Take time for yourself, use the arrival of warmer days for walks, cycling, rollerblading or hiking. Over time, it will become part of your routine throughout the day, which will make you feel great, and you will see that the result will not fail.</h4><h1>
Take smaller portions</h1><p>
Food portions have grown unnecessarily in recent times. A healthy diet means smaller portions and you should stick to that. When eating out, choose an appetizer instead of a main course or share a meal with a friend. At home, use smaller plates and don't overcrowd them.</p><h1>
Drink sufficient amounts of water</h1><p>
Water makes up about 75% of our body and plays a major role in expelling toxins and other unwanted waste. Many people ignore the importance of water and go through life dehydrated which causes fatigue, lack of energy and headaches. It is believed that everyone should consume 8 glasses of water a day.</p><p>
Try to follow these steps and we are sure that healthy eating will become your daily routine.</p></div>`

The average daily intake of calories is 2000, and it depends on many factors, such as physical activity, gender and age. Losing weight is mathematically very simple - in order to lose weight, you need to consume more calories than you take in. Along with proper nutrition and physical activity, there are nutritional supplements on the market that can help you achieve your goal.</p><h4>
Dietary supplements for weight loss cannot be expected to have an effect without giving up. A weight loss program should primarily include a proper and balanced diet and an appropriate level of physical activity.</h4><p>
L-carnitine is produced from the amino acids methionine and lysine with the help of vitamin C, vitamin B6, iron and niacin. Its main role is the transfer of fatty acids into the cell, which it then converts into energy. The food richest in L-carnitine is red meat. It is popular among athletes because it increases endurance and helps strengthen muscles. In the form of weight loss, it makes sense to take food supplements with L-carnitine exclusively with physical activity, otherwise the effect will be absent.</p><p>Garcinia (Garcinia cambogia) is a tropical fruit that is popular in weight loss supplements because it reduces appetite and fat synthesis. The active ingredient is hydroxycitric acid, which prevents the action of the enzyme citrate lyase, which is necessary for the formation of fatty acids. It will also increase serotonin levels in the brain, which increases the feeling of satiety. According to recent research, garcinia lowers the levels of triglycerides and LDL ("bad cholesterol"), and increases the levels of HDL ("good cholesterol"), but it should not be taken if there is already a cholesterol-lowering drug in therapy.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/nutrition/dietary_supplements_to_help_with_weight_loss_alt.jpeg" alt="dietary_supplements_to_help_with_weight_loss_alt"/><p>Glucomannan is a water-soluble fiber consisting of long chains of indigestible polysaccharides. It should be taken with large amounts of water, with which it swells in the stomach and creates a feeling of satiety. Glucomannan is also food for "good" bacteria in the intestines, lowers cholesterol levels in the blood and stimulates digestion. To achieve the effect, it should be taken before a meal.</p><p>
Apple pectins are types of soluble fiber that stimulate intestinal peristalsis and facilitate digestion. They create a gel in the intestines and thus create a feeling of satiety and reduce the absorption of fat and sugar. Like glucomannan, they need to be taken with large amounts of water.</p><p>
Diuretics are substances that stimulate the excretion of fluid from the body. Before taking diuretics, it is necessary to consult a doctor or pharmacist, due to possible interactions with existing drugs in therapy, and herbal diuretics should not be used by people with diabetes or kidney failure.</p><p>
Goldenrod (Solidago virgaurea) is a plant that acts as a diuretic with spasmolytic and anti-inflammatory effects. It contains flavonoids as active substances. It can be used in the form of a herbal preparation or as a tea.</p><p>
Horsetail (Equisetum arvense) is a strong herbal diuretic and is often used for high blood pressure. It is rich in minerals, especially silicon, so it can also help women suffering from osteoporosis.</p><p>
Birch (Betula pendula) is also a powerful herbal diuretic that is often used for urinary infections. The main components attributed to the action are flavonoids and phenolic acids.</p></div>`

In the winter months, the most common irritating symptom of a cold is a cough. Which preparation to use depends on the type of cough.</p><p>
We distinguish between two types of cough depending on the presence of mucus:</p><ul><li>
productive cough, the so-called a wet cough is accompanied by excessive production of thick mucus that is difficult to cough up</li><li>
a dry cough has no mucus to cough up, so the cough is irritating and unpleasant.</li></ul><h4>
Often, colds and viral infections start with a non-productive cough, which after a few days turns into a productive one, since the mucous membrane produces more and more mucus. In this case, a combination of herbs in syrup can help, which will reduce irritation to cough and facilitate expectoration.</h4><p>
The following 5 points provide possible solutions for suppressing cough.</p><ul><li>Antitussives are medicines used to calm a dry irritating cough without mucus. Of the herbal medicines, there are extracts of Icelandic lichen, plantain and marshmallow, which, due to the content of herbal mucus, coat and moisten the mucous membrane of the mouth and throat and, by creating a protective layer, reduce irritation to cough. They come in syrup and lozenge form. Icelandic lichen and marshmallow syrup can be used by children from one year of age, and plantain syrup is suitable for adults and children over 3 years old. They can also help with hoarseness and sore throat. 
If there is no relief of symptoms with herbal preparations, a synthetic drug against dry cough (butamirate) that is available in pharmacies without a doctor's prescription can be used. It can be used by adults and children over one year old.</li><li>
Expectorants and mucolytics are used for productive cough. Extracts of thyme, primrose and ivy have the property of thinning mucus and thereby promote and facilitate expectoration. Three synthetic over-the-counter medicines are available in pharmacies to ease expectoration (acetylcysteine, bromhexine, ambroxol). The dosage depends on the form, and some forms of these drugs are suitable for children from two years of age. The simultaneous use of these drugs and antitussives to suppress cough is not recommended because it can cause secretion stagnation due to a reduced cough reflex.</li><li>Ointments of camphor, menthol, eucalyptus and some essential oils can be used to relieve cough symptoms for external application on the skin or inhalation. Ointments are applied to the skin of the chest, neck or back in a thin layer several times a day. Care must be taken not to develop an allergic reaction after applying the ointment. Children over 4 years old can use ointments with camphor, while ointments with menthol can be used by children over 6 years old. Inhalation of fats or essential oils can be applied using a container or diffuser, never through an inhaler.</li><li>Inhalation with water vapor moistens the mucous membrane of the nose and throat and can contribute to the relief of coughing and the reduction of nasal congestion that is often present with coughing. Inhalations can be carried out using an inhaler. If the cough is accompanied by copious secretions from the nose, it is necessary to clean the nose regularly with hypertonic solutions and possibly apply decongestant drops for the nose that are available without a prescription in pharmacies.</li><li>Increased intake of liquids, water or warm tea moistens the mucous membrane of the airways and reduces irritation, and enhances the effect of mucolytics, substances that thin mucus in productive coughs. For adults, it is recommended to drink 2 L of liquid per day and avoid drinks that promote dehydration (alcohol, coffee).</li></ul><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/nutrition/5_cough_remedies_alt.jpeg" alt="five_cough_remedies_alt"/><p>
If the cough is accompanied by a fever that does not go away with the use of fever-reducing drugs or if the discharge is purulent, yellowish-brown or green in color, you should contact your doctor.</p></div>`

Essential oils contain numerous volatile and biologically active substances that have a wide range of effects and are therefore used for inhalation for various purposes. Find out how to choose the right and recognize a pure essential oil, how to apply it by inhalation and which essential oil to choose in a certain condition through the answers to 3 questions</p><h1>
Why do essential oils from pharmacies have an advantage in quality?</h1><p>
Essential oils can be adulterated, i.e. replaced with other substances of natural or synthetic origin, or subjected to unnecessary and quick methods that change the composition of the essential oil and reduce its effectiveness. Essential oils must be properly labeled and their quality must correspond to international standards.</p><h4>Only chemotyped oils whose composition is precisely defined have a therapeutic effect.</h4><p>A well-marked essential oil contains the name, Latin name of the plant that is the raw material, part of the plant from which it is produced, chemotype (composition), method of obtaining and cultivation, country of cultivation, allergens, toxicological label, expiration date and batch label. Priority in the selection is given to chemotyped oils and those that have a guarantee of the quality of production, raw materials and finished products checked in independent laboratories.</p><p>
Certificates of analysis serve as proof of quality and non-adulteration and are available online for certain essential oils.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/nutrition/3_essential_things_about_essential_oils_for_inhalation_alt.jpeg" alt="3_essential_things_about_essential_oils_for_inhalation_alt"/><h1>
How to apply essential oil by inhalation?</h1><p>
Inhalations can be done in three ways:</p><ul><li>using steam</li><li>dry inhalation </li><li>using a diffuser</li></ul><p>
Steam inhalations are done by gradually adding a small amount of essential oil to avoid irritation that can occur from a larger amount of essential oil. Today, there are inhalers with a water tank and a mouth and nose attachment, so there is no need to cover with a towel, which makes inhalation more comfortable. Add one to two drops of essential oil to 500 ml of hot water and inhale for one minute. Then the same amount of drops is added again and inhaled for one minute, and the procedure is repeated up to 10-15 drops and a total of 10 minutes of inhalation.</p><p>Dry inhalation can be done using a dry handkerchief on which two drops of essential oil are dripped and inhaled for several minutes several times a day. This inhalation can also be done by dripping essential oil on a towel or cotton wool that is placed next to the pillow during sleep. At the same time, it is necessary to take care that the essential oil does not come into direct contact with the skin, in order not to develop an allergic reaction.</p><h4>
People with asthma and COPD should avoid steam inhalation and dry inhalation as it could worsen the condition.</h4><p>
In the winter months, during the season of respiratory infections, diffusers, devices that do not heat the essential oils, but disperse them cold and unchanged into the air, are especially practical. In addition to pleasantly aromatizing the space, inhaling essential oils manifests their beneficial effects.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/nutrition/3_essential_things_about_essential_oils_for_inhalation_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="3_essential_things_about_essential_oils_for_inhalation_alt_alt"/><p>
We distinguish between two types of diffusers:</p><ul><li>
Classic diffusers work without water, so they disperse only essential oil and thus saturate the air with essential oil faster.</li><li>
Ultrasonic diffusers disperse essential oil and water, which moistens the air, which is desirable in the winter months when the air indoors is mostly dry. Compared to classic diffusers, they disperse a smaller amount of essential oils, but this amount is also satisfactory.</li></ul><h1>
Which essential oils are most often used?</h1><p>Since certain essential oils act on pathogenic viruses and bacteria in the air, they are often used during the season of respiratory infections. For this purpose, the oils of eucalyptus globulus and radiata, ravensara, niaulia chemotype cineol, tea tree and cajeputa are most often used.</p><p>
Eucalyptus oil is especially used for coughs because it facilitates expectoration. It can be used by adults and children over 3 years old, and Eucalyptus radiata can be used by children under 3 years old and pregnant women.</p><p>
During pregnancy, the use of ravensara essential oil, tea tree, lavender, mandravasarotra and ho oil is safe. In the first trimester, direct inhalation should be avoided, but inhalation through a diffuser is allowed.</p><p>In order to improve the smell, in addition to the mentioned oils, essential oils such as lemon or grapefruit can be combined, or ready-made mixtures can be used, such as Aromaforce mixture and Force et Vitalite.</p><p>
Some oils have a calming effect, such as lavender, cedar and bergamot essential oils. Citrus oils (such as lemon, grapefruit, bitter or sweet orange) can be used for the same purpose, but their lemony smell has a calming effect on some people, while on others they have the opposite effect.</p></div>`

Acute diarrhea is defined as more than 3 soft or watery stools within 24 hours. It usually lasts less than 7 days, no longer than 14 days. The most common causes of acute diarrhea are intestinal infection or food poisoning. The goal of therapy is to prevent or treat dehydration and bring the intestines back into balance. This is achieved in the following ways:</p><ul><li>Oral rehydration salts (ORS) contain certain amounts of glucose and salts that are lost with diarrhea. Such solutions accelerate the recovery of the intestinal mucosa, which reduces the duration of diarrhea and increased salt and fluid loss. Replenishment of lost water and electrolytes is recommended for everyone, especially children, because they are at a higher risk of severe dehydration. Due to the salty taste, children may refuse ORS, so flavored ones can be used. The ORS solution is drunk in small sips, and the recommended amount depends on the degree of dehydration. Water, soups and other liquids are not adequate substitutes for ORS due to the unknown electrolyte composition.</li><li>
Probiotics that can reduce the severity of diarrhea and shorten its duration by 1 day are Lactobacillus rhamnosus LGG in a dose per day for 5-7 days, and Saccharomyces boulardii in a dose of 250-750 mg/day also for 5-7 days. Both probiotics can be used by infants.</li><li>
Adsorbents have the ability to bind metabolites and toxins of microorganisms and gases in the digestive system and increase their elimination from the digestive system. These are activated medicinal charcoal and silicic acid gel. Due to the ability to bind drugs, they can reduce their therapeutic effect, so it is necessary to separate them in time by at least 2 hours. Activated medical charcoal can be used by children over 3 years old, and silicic acid gels by children over one year old.</li><li>
Loperamide is an OTC drug that reduces the frequency of stools in diarrhea. It is used exclusively as symptomatic therapy in children over 12 years of age and adults if the cause of diarrhea is not known. If there is no improvement in 2 days, you should contact your doctor.</li><li>Diet. After rehydration, it is recommended to continue with a normal diet that meets energy needs. Breastfeeding should be continued throughout rehydration. Avoid canned and sweet fruit juices, as they can worsen diarrhea.</li><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/nutrition/5_ways_to_solve_acute_diarrhea_in_children_and_adults_alt.jpeg" alt="5_ways_to_solve_acute_diarrhea_in_children_and_adults_alt"/><p>
If there is a high temperature, blood in the stool, severe dehydration, lack of urine within 12 hours and if there is no improvement after 48 hours, you should contact your doctor.</p>

Magnesium deficiency is increasingly common nowadays, and the most noticeable symptoms of deficiency are cramps in the calves and muscles . Food sources of magnesium are green leafy vegetables, nuts, tea, coffee, yeast and whole grains. The recommended daily dose of magnesium is 360-380 mg.</p><p>
In the sea of ​​dietary supplements with magnesium, it is difficult to choose the right preparation for your needs. There are different technological forms on the market, such as tablets, effervescent tablets, capsules, direct forms or powders, which mainly depend on personal preferences, and special attention should be paid to the chemical form.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/nutrition/which_form_of_magnesium_to_choose_alt.jpeg" alt="which_form_of_magnesium_to_choose_alt"/><p>Magnesium comes in the form of inorganic and organic salts. Magnesium oxide and carbonate belong to inorganic forms and they have lower bioavailability in the body compared to organic forms of magnesium, which include malate, citrate, glycinate, taurate and others. Magnesium absorption can be further improved with vitamin B6 and vitamin D, while fiber, fat and alcohol will reduce it.</p><h1>
Organic forms of magnesium often come in lower concentrations than inorganic ones, but they are much more bioavailable.</h1><h3>
Inorganic forms of magnesium</h3><ul><li>
The role of magnesium oxide is the short-term relief of digestive disorders such as constipation and heartburn. It is one of the most common forms in food supplements and has a very low bioavailability (less than 15%).</li><li>
Magnesium carbonate is primarily used as an antacid (relieves heartburn) and has a slightly higher bioavailability compared to the oxide.</li><li>
Inorganic forms of magnesium include magnesium sulfate, better known as "bitter salt", which belongs to the group of osmotic laxatives and as such is often used before surgical procedures.</li></ul><h3>
Organic forms of magnesium</h3><ul><li>Magnesium citrate is most often used as a laxative, it works by drawing water into the intestines and softening the stool, and it can also help to relax muscles.</li><li>
Magnesium taurate is used to control high blood pressure and, according to the latest research, to control blood sugar. It crosses the blood-brain barrier very well and can therefore be used to reduce anxiety symptoms.</li><li>
Magnesium malate is the best form of magnesium for athletes and people suffering from chronic fatigue because malic acid is a key component of enzymes involved in energy production processes.</li><li>Magnesium glycinate shows the highest absorption rate in the body and is considered the "gold standard" of magnesium. Along with magnesium taurate, it plays the most important role in preventing migraines and reducing the frequency of headaches. It is used to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia. It can help with various inflammatory conditions, diabetes and heart disease. Unlike other forms of magnesium, it has no laxative effect.</li></ul><p>
It is often advised to take magnesium supplements in the evening, due to its relaxing effect, which is not the case for magnesium malate. Dietary supplements with magnesium should be taken during or after a meal, so that diarrhea does not occur.</p></div>`

Collagen is one of the most important and abundant proteins in our body. We find it in the composition of connective tissue where, together with elastin and reticulin, it forms a functional network of fibers in which all the cells of our body are immersed. Our body can synthesize collagen, but after the age of 25, the body gradually produces less and less of its own collagen, and at the same time, the quality of the synthesized collagen decreases. As a result, over the years there is thinning and loss of firmness of the skin, appearance of wrinkles, increase in bone fragility, weakening of the tone of blood vessels, loss of cartilage and pain in the joints, etc.</p><p>
This physiological loss can be compensated through increasingly popular food supplements containing collagen obtained from animal sources (most often from cattle and fish). That is why we bring you advice and answers to the most common questions that arise when choosing food supplements with collagen.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/nutrition/collagen_in_the_sea_of_dietary_supplements_how_to_choose_the_best_one_for_you_alt.jpeg" alt="collagen_in_the_sea_of_dietary_supplements_how_to_choose_the_best_one_for_you_alt"/><h1>How do food supplements with collagen work?</h1><p>Food supplements with collagen contain partially decomposed collagen, i.e. collagen hydrolyzate. Upon arrival in the digestive system, collagen peptides are broken down into smaller structural units (di- and tri-peptides) which are then absorbed in the small intestine. It is believed that after that, the peptides reach other organs (mainly skin and cartilage) through the bloodstream, where they stimulate connective tissue cells to increase collagen synthesis. Therefore, it is not surprising that some of the proven effects of dietary supplements with collagen are:</p><ul><li>
reduction of wrinkles and increase of elasticity and hydration of the skin</li><li>
stimulating the growth, strength and shine of nails and hair</li><li>
faster healing of postoperative wounds</li><li>
alleviating joint pain and increasing flexibility</li><li>
strengthening of bones and faster recovery after operations or injuries</li><li>faster recovery and increase in muscle mass after exercise</li><li>
strengthening the walls of blood vessels.</li></ul><h1>Dosage and correct application of preparations with collagen?</h1><p>
The recommended intake for adults, with proven positive effects on the skin and musculoskeletal system, is 5000-10000 mg/day. The daily dose can be taken all at once or divided into several individual doses throughout the day.</p><h4>
Food supplements with collagen should be taken continuously
at least 8 - 12 weeks in order to achieve positive effects.</h4><p>
If it is combined with regular exercise, the preparation should be taken approximately one hour before exercise for maximum effect. It is preferable to take collagen with meals due to increased secretion of digestive enzymes. The presence of food also enables more complete absorption, and thus the availability of peptides from collagen.</p><h1>Why is collagen in food supplements combined with other ingredients?</h1><p>
Various vitamins, minerals and plant extracts are added to collagen in dietary supplements, which try to affect other steps of collagen synthesis or physiological processes of tissue renewal. In this way, a better effect is achieved, which gives the final product additional value in terms of quality.</p><p>For example, vitamin C is a key cofactor that participates in collagen synthesis. It contributes to the normal formation of firm and compact collagen fibers and protects cells from oxidative stress. The second most common supplement is hyaluronic acid, which plays an important role in retaining moisture in the intercellular spaces, thus restoring volume to the skin and increasing the flexibility of the joints. Substances needed by the cells for enhanced collagen synthesis are often added, such as vitamin B complex and minerals such as zinc and manganese (eg Yasenka Skinage Collagen Prestige). Substances such as chondroitin, glucosamine and extracts of the Indian frankincense plant can be added to collagen-based preparations, which have been proven to contribute to strengthening cartilage and bones and reducing joint pain.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/nutrition/collagen_in_the_sea_of_dietary_supplements_how_to_choose_the_best_one_for_you_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="collagen_in_the_sea_of_dietary_supplements_how_to_choose_the_best_one_for_you_alt_alt"/><h1>Is there a difference between collagen in powder, tablet or liquid form?</h1><p>Liquid forms have an advantage over tablets because they bypass the process of disintegration and dissolution of the tablet and the active ingredients are immediately in contact with digestive enzymes. Powdered collagen is usually prepared with water or juice, which is why there is very little difference between the level of absorption from the finished liquid form of collagen and that prepared by dissolving the powder.</p><p>
With the liquid form, it is easier to achieve higher concentrations of collagen compared to tablets, which greatly facilitates application. Doses of liquid preparations usually range from 25-50 ml/day, while for the same dose of collagen in tablet form, several tablets should be taken per day (depending on the manufacturer).</p><h1>How can vegetarians and vegans increase collagen synthesis?</h1><p>
Since collagen as a protein is present only in foods of animal origin, there is no equivalent alternative to it in foods of plant origin. Despite this, it is possible to influence the increase in collagen synthesis by ingesting plant proteins with an amino acid composition similar to collagen (rich in proline and glycine), such as soy. In addition, it is desirable to combine food supplements based on vitamins and minerals essential for collagen synthesis and skin strengthening. Preparations based on silicon have a similar effect on collagen synthesis, since this mineral activates key enzymes in the collagen synthesis pathway.</p></div>`

Many are at risk of vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency</h1><p>People with insufficient exposure to the sun (infants, hospitalized patients, institutionalized persons), then elderly people, pregnant women, nursing mothers, dark-skinned people, obese people are at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. It is believed that in areas north of 40° latitude, the production of vitamin D in the skin during winter is inadequate. Therefore, replacement application of vitamin D and monitoring of its concentrations in the blood are particularly important for the inhabitants of the Republic of Croatia, especially its continental part.</p><h1>The importance of vitamin D for health is great</h1><p>
Vitamin D is necessary for the absorption of calcium from the intestines and for maintaining bone density. In addition, the role of vitamin D in human health is much broader. Acting as an immunomodulator, it plays an important role in innate and acquired immunity. Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with an increased frequency of bacterial and viral infections. During the current coronavirus pandemic, studies were conducted that showed that daily intake of vitamin D has protective properties against respiratory infections.</p><p>
Preventive measures provide a daily intake of vitamin D in a dose of:</p><ul><li>400IU for children up to one year</li><li>
600IU for people from 1 to 70 years old</li><li>800IU for older than 70</li></ul><p>Patients belonging to risk groups should take 1500 - 2000IU of vitamin D daily. Low concentrations of vitamin D in the blood can be expected in numerous diseases, especially chronic diseases of the heart, kidneys, liver, malignant, autoimmune, neurological diseases, diabetes, so the replacement of vitamin D is beneficial for health. Additionally, along with certain medications, such as glucocorticoids and aromatase inhibitors for the treatment of breast cancer, calcium and vitamin D supplementation is necessary to maintain bone mass density.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/nutrition/3_points_that_reveal_why_everyone_is_talking_about_vitamin_d_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="3_points_that_reveal_why_everyone_is_talking_about_vitamin_d_alt_alt"/><h1>
Simple prevention and simple treatment of hypovitaminosis D</h1><p>Vitamin D is available on the market in different forms and doses. There are drops, sprays, capsules and ampoules with different dosages. Depending on the dose of the particular form, vitamin D can be dosed with different frequency - every day, once or twice a week or monthly, which increases cooperation when taking it. After three months of replacement therapy, it is recommended to check the concentration of vitamin D in the blood.</p></div>`

What is ragweed?</h1><p>Ragweed is a weedy plant that produces a large amount of pollen. Pollen is the cause of the plant's high allergenic potential. Ragweed produces 8 million pollen grains during 5 hours, and 20 to 30 grains per m3 is enough to cause an allergic reaction. Pollen has a high aerogenic potential, the wind spreads up to one kilometer around the plant. Ambrosia inhabits abandoned habitats, and grows as a weed in soybean, sunflower, and corn plantations. The highest concentration of pollen is during August and early September, when the incidence of allergic reactions is highest.</p><h1>
How can we fight ragweed?</h1><p>
The spread of ragweed can be controlled by hoeing, weeding, weeding, mowing and using herbicides. If you notice the presence of ragweed, inform the Institute of Public Health. The best effects of eliminating ragweed are achieved when the plant is not in the flowering phase.</p><h1>
What is an allergy and what are the symptoms of ragweed allergy?</h1><p>
An allergy is a reaction of our immune system to substances such as pollen. Substances that cause allergic reactions are called allergens.</p><p>
Pollen enters the body through the air through the respiratory system. The most common reactions to pollen allergens are itching, swelling of the eyelids, runny nose and sneezing, and in some people it can cause much more serious reactions: coughing, shortness of breath. We can become sensitive to pollen, as well as other allergens, during our lifetime.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/ambrosia_and_allergy_alt.jpeg" alt="ragweed_and_allergy_alt"/><h1>Self-help measures and treatment</h1><p>
The highest concentration of pollen is during sunny and windy days, in the morning and afternoon. During this period, it is not recommended to ventilate the apartment or stay outdoors. Keep the windows closed while driving. It is good to plan your stay outdoors after the rain when the concentration of pollen in the air is the lowest.</p><p>
It is recommended to take a shower after a long stay outdoors, as well as to rinse the nose with seawater solutions with substances that coat the mucous membrane and create a physical barrier on the mucous membrane, such as hy-cell complex and ectoine. Seawater solutions moisturize, and the hy-cell complex and ectoin reduce the contact of the mucous membrane with pollen, and consequently reduce irritation.</p><p>
If the allergic reaction is unpleasant with the symptoms of itching, runny nose, itchy eyes, sneezing, nasal congestion, we use antihistamine drugs that will reduce the intensity of the allergic reaction. We can act preventively on the body in order to strengthen immunity and reduce the intensity of allergic reactions using preparations based on antioxidants quercetin and black cumin oil.</p><h1>
Pollen forecast</h1><p>
The Institute for Public Health publishes a pollen forecast every day, with a detailed description of the concentration of pollen in the air. By following the pollen forecast, we can adjust our daily outdoor activities.</p></div>`

Sunburns are caused by excessive exposure to the sun, which depends not only on the intensity of solar radiation and the length of time spent in the sun, but also on skin thickness, phototype and hydration. A short exposure to the sun is enough to cause burns. Since the harmfulness of the sun's rays accumulates throughout life, especially in childhood and adolescence, small children and adolescents should be especially protected from the sun.</li><li>
Sunburns can also occur when the weather is cloudy because UV rays pass through the clouds. Snow, ice, light sand and water reflect UV rays and can have almost the same effect on the formation of burns as direct sunlight.</li><li>Sunburns develop 6 hours after exposure to the sun, they are strongest in the first 24 hours. If the skin is red and hot immediately after sunbathing, severe burns can be expected later. If general symptoms such as dizziness, headache, fever, confusion, rapid heart rate or shallow breathing appear in addition to the resulting sunburn, you should contact your doctor.</li><li>
Some medications can increase sensitivity to UV radiation, so it is recommended to use preparations with high protection. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are using such a medicine.</li><li>
Products that state that they contain natural UV protection, such as raspberry oil, have no evidence of the exact level of protection, and it is recommended to use products with precisely defined protection against UVA and UVB rays.</li><li>If sunburn occurs, it is necessary to drink as much liquid as possible, and to cool the skin with cooling compresses, lotions, balms and gels. Skin recovery after burns can be enhanced by preparations of dexpanthenol, which moisturizes the skin and promotes epithelization, gel of aloe vera and chamomile, and fish oil, which, due to its properties, promotes skin healing.</li><li>Certain supplements can reduce the negative effect of UV radiation and help the skin recover from existing damage. Due to their antioxidant properties for skin protection, the most effective application is beta kerotene, astaxanthin, lutein, lycopene, vitamins C, E and A, as well as selenium and zinc and their combinations.</li></ul><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/education_on_the_prevention_and_relief_of_sunburn_in_7_points_alt.jpeg" alt="education_on_the_prevention_and_relief_of_sunburn_in_7_points"/><h4>Sun protection products are effective in preventing sunburn. In order for the indicated SPF to be effective, it is crucial to apply the product in sufficient quantity, which means that 6 teaspoons of the product (approx. 36g) should be used to lubricate the body of an average adult.
A reduced amount of product significantly reduces the level of protection and increases the risk of burns. However, sun protection products do not provide 100% protection, so it is necessary to adhere to the rules of avoiding excessive sunbathing from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., wearing hats, glasses and t-shirts, and the protection itself must be applied at least 30 minutes before exposure to the sun, renewed every 2 hours, especially after sweating, bathing and wiping with a towel.</h4></div>`

Wrinkles and increased pigmentation are changes that become more pronounced and visible on our skin as we age. 90% of visible changes are caused by cumulative damage caused by exposure to solar radiation during our lifetime. We call such changes photoaging. Photoaging accelerates the process of chronological aging of the skin, and it depends on exposure to solar radiation and the amount of melanin in the skin cells.</p><h1>
UVA, UVB.. what is it?</h1><p>Solar radiation is not visible. Part of the radiation is felt as heat on the skin, and it is caused by thermal (infrared) rays. Another type of radiation is the so-called ultraviolet radiation. UV radiation consists of two types of waves, UVA and UVB. When UVB rays penetrate our skin, we do not feel it, but see the change, the skin will change color, become "tanned". The color change occurs because the skin cells produce a substance called melanin to protect the cellular DNA (the carrier of all information about us) from mutations (unwanted changes). UVA rays penetrate deeper through the skin into the skin dermis and lead to the breakdown of collagen (proteins important for the resistance and strength of the skin). Unfortunately, the creation of high-quality new collagen stops, the so-called formation occurs. solar scar, visible changes in the structure and deepening of wrinkles.</p><h4>Long-term exposure to UV radiation will cause dryness, loss of elasticity, pigmentation, wrinkles and even for some people, unfortunately, skin cancer.</h4><p>
In addition to UV and IR rays, the latest research has shown that the blue light emitted by our mobile phones, lamps... can also sample skin damage.</p><h1>Prevention is important</h1><p>
We cannot avoid daily exposure to radiation, but we can protect our skin. Exposure of the skin to UV radiation causes oxidative stress, which can lead to inflammatory reactions in the skin. Numerous studies have confirmed that antioxidant treatments by taking preparations orally and protecting the skin by applying creams with SPF give the best results in protecting the skin from damage. Taking preparations with vitamin E, selenium (strong antioxidants), coenzyme Q10 (protects against cell death caused by oxidative stress), argan and borage plant oils and the exceptional antioxidant astaxanthin - a month before, during exposure in the summer period and a month after, reduces stress and protects our skin.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/the_influence_of_the_sun_on_skin_health_alt.jpeg" alt="the_influence_of_the_sun_on_skin_health_alt"/><h1>What does SPF mean?</h1><p>
SPF is the abbreviation for sun protection factor, which indicates to what extent and for how long the cream will protect the skin from burns caused by UVB rays for a certain skin phototype. Depending on the phototype, the skin can be exposed to the sun for 5-30 minutes without burning. For the best protection, experts suggest using a minimum protection of SPF 15 in the appropriate amount (2mg/cm2 of skin) every 2 hours. If a sufficient amount of protection cream is not applied, e.g. half of the recommended amount for an SPF 30 cream, the effectiveness will be only SPF 5.5! Various antioxidants, UVA filters and protection against blue light damage are added to sun protection products.</p><h4>The skin is the largest organ of the body. Skin health is important for the health of the whole organism. We need to protect the skin, especially in the summer months by applying protective preparations, by introducing supplements that will give the skin a long-term healthy look while reducing photodamage, and consequently accelerated aging.</h4></div>`

Inhalers are very useful systems for the delivery of drugs for acute or chronic bronchitis, allergies and lung diseases such as asthma and COPD. Inhalation of saline or hypertonic salt solution is also known to relieve symptoms such as cough and nasal congestion in flu, colds and COVID-19.</h4><p>
Due to the extremely rapid relief of symptoms in the above-mentioned conditions, it is no wonder that inhalers have recently become an almost indispensable part of the "home pharmacy". Below you can read more about proper use and types of inhalers offered on our market.</p><h1>
Types of inhalers and tips for proper use</h1><p>
Considering the liquid dispersion mechanism in the so-called nebula, we distinguish between compressor and ultrasonic inhalers. Most compressor inhalers require use in an upright position, as this ensures proper distribution of the liquid in the cup and delivery of the total dose of medicine.</p><p>
Ultrasonic inhalers are quieter and (mostly) smaller in size compared to compressor ones, and there are portable battery-powered versions. This makes it easier to use for users who need inhalation often and in various environments outside the home, such as traveling or work.</p><p>
Essential oils must not drip into the cup of a compressor or ultrasonic inhaler, as this can clog the entire system. If inhalation therapy is planned with the use of essential oils, it is necessary to use special containers suitable for aromatherapy, such as Apipharma Apipol Pot for Inhalation.</p><h4>Cleaning and disinfection of inhalation attachments is a quick and simple procedure, and it is best to perform it immediately after inhalation so that all parts are well dried before the next use.</h4><p>
The step most often forgotten by users is the proper maintenance of the inhaler and cup. This can lead to the accumulation of microorganisms or drug particles remaining from the previous inhalation.</p><p>
The instructions for disinfecting the parts depend on the manufacturer and the material from which the inhalation attachments are made, and are always indicated in the instructions that come with the device. Depending on the frequency of use, all inhaler tips should be replaced after a while. That's why there is a possibility to buy sequels or sets separately.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/how_to_choose_and_use_an_inhaler_for_children_or_adults_alt.jpeg" alt="how_to_choose_and_use_an_inhaler_for_children_or_adults"/><h1>
Inhalers for babies and children</h1><p>Babies are a special population that can suffer from stuffy noses and coughs several times a year. There are special inhalers that are suitable for inhaling and gently cleaning babies' noses. This unique combination in one device works on the symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infections. By cleaning the nostrils with an aspirator, the risk of ear infections and bronchitis can be reduced, and at the same time it allows the child to breathe, sleep and eat more easily.</p><p>In somewhat older children, it is often a problem to persuade the child to inhale, but also to remain still during the application, especially if the inhalation lasts longer. This is why there are specially designed inhalers with cheerful shapes or they come in combination with toys.</p><p>
Ultrasonic inhalers can be used in a lying position and are much quieter compared to compressor inhalers, which is why inhalation is possible even with a sleeping child.</p><h1>Inhalers for the whole family</h1><p>If inhalation therapy is needed for several household members, inhalers that are suitable for all age groups are often considered for reasons of economy. Such inhalers in the basic package usually contain a mask for adults and children and a mouthpiece. There is the possibility of buying other extensions, such as a shower for rinsing the nose. It is also the only compressor inhaler suitable for use in the supine position. An average inhalation (2.5 ml of liquid) takes 6 - 8 minutes with these inhalers. Due to the mentioned characteristics, these models are among the most popular when it comes to inhalation products for the whole family.</p></div>`

                subContent: `<div class="blog-wrapper"><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/how_to_prepare_for_allergy_season.webp" alt="how_to_prepare_for_allergy_season"/><p>With the arrival of spring, the allergy season begins. Allergies occur when the immune system overreacts to harmless substances (such as pollen, dust, etc.), treating them as potential threats. This leads to a series of chemical reactions in the body and the activation of cells called mast cells, which begin to release inflammatory mediators, the most important of which is histamine. The release of histamine causes typical allergy symptoms, such as itchy eyes, runny nose and sneezing.</p><p>
In addition to classic antihistamine therapy, there are also ways to prepare for the allergy season, in order to reduce symptoms. For these purposes, the most important role is played by black cumin, membranous goat's milk, curcumin and quercetin.</p><h4>
In order to have an effect, black cumin, goat's milk, curcumin and quercetin should be taken at least one month before the allergy season.</h4><p>Black cumin oil (Nigella sativa) contains unsaturated fatty acids, essential oils, essential amino acids and vitamins and minerals. The most abundant unsaturated fatty acid is gamma-linolenic and it has an impact on the body's immune response. With its regulatory action, it can significantly reduce, and often even neutralize, excessive reactions to allergens. Essential oils calm and clean the upper respiratory tract, which is useful for allergic reactions and respiratory infections. In addition to the above, black cumin oil also has antioxidant and antifungal effects.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/how_to_prepare_for_allergy_season_alt.jpeg" alt="how_to_prepare_for_allergy_season_alt"/><p>
Because of all the beneficial effects on the body and the immune system, hundreds of studies have been done on black cumin oil. It has been proven that it can help with stomach problems, high blood pressure, sleep disorders and headaches. Gamma-linolenic acid is a component of human skin and can help with skin diseases.</p><p>
Astragalus membranaceus is a plant of traditional Chinese medicine. It has a positive effect on allergies, heart disease, chronic fatigue and diabetes. It has an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect. It can help with bacterial and viral infections and strengthens the body's resistance to external factors, such as allergens.</p><p>
The active ingredient of turmeric (Curcuma longa) is curcumin, a polyphenol with anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, antioxidant and antitumor properties. It inhibits the release of histamine from mast cells, on which the anti-allergic effect is based</p><p>
Although turmeric is becoming more and more popular as a spice, the curcumin content is only 3%, and in order to achieve the beneficial effects, you should still resort to dietary supplements. Due to low bioavailability, you should choose those preparations where curcumin is found in special solubilized formulas in micelles or where substances such as black pepper have been added, which increase its bioavailability.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/how_to_prepare_for_allergy_season_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="how_to_prepare_for_allergy_season_alt_alt"/><p>Quercetin belongs to the group of bioflavonoids and primarily has a strong antioxidant effect, which is why it is often the first choice for strengthening immunity. Like curcumin, quercetin inhibits the release of histamine and exhibits anti-allergic effects. The latest studies show that taking quercetin for a minimum of 5 days continuously reduces symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose and itchy nose.</p><p>
In addition to the mentioned preparations, it is advisable to take calcium and vitamin C. Calcium works by reducing the permeability of capillaries and thus alleviates the allergic reaction, and vitamin C reduces the level of histamine.</p><p>
In order to choose the product that best suits your needs, for questions about contraindications and the method of application, ask our pharmacists for advice.</p></div>`,

During the cold months, the skin requires additional care, protection and hydration. The skin is exposed to UV rays, wind, cold, low humidity and air pollution. Regardless of the type and condition of the skin, harmful influences make the skin dry, cracked, tight, dehydrated and red. Damage to the hydrolipid film of the skin and consequent loss of moisture can be of varying intensity. If the skin is very dry and the hydrolipid film of the skin is severely damaged, the skin becomes unprotected and susceptible to infections. Due to the removal of the stratum corneum and damage to the hydrolipidic film, it is important to replace the ingredients used to regenerate the hydrolipidic film, such as ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids and pantothenic acid, as they have the role of attracting and retaining water. This allows the cells of the stratum corneum to remain properly connected, i.e. not dehydrated, which is the main prerequisite for maintaining the skin's protective function. Low temperatures favor increased keratinization of the skin, so it looks rougher and wrinkles are more visible.</p><p>
The skin of the hands, which is the most exposed, suffers the most damage in the colder months, and even painful damage can occur. The skin of the legs and other parts of the body can also be very rough, so it is recommended to use mild and soothing creams.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/skin_protection_in_winter_alt.jpeg" alt="skin_protection_in_winter_alt"><p>
Dermocosmetic preparations include:</p><ul><li>emollients or skin moisturizers, agents intended to moisturize and soften the stratum corneum, thereby reducing or completely eliminating itching, scaling and redness on the skin. They include creams, lotions and syndets. By applying a layer of emollient to the skin, the spaces between the cells of the stratum corneum where there is a lack of lipids are filled, thus helping to restore moisture to the skin. To be effective, lipids must be applied frequently, at least three to four times a day, so it is important that the emollient is applied lightly. For a more intensive effect, they are applied under occlusion, which means wrapping parts of the body in foil, usually during the night.</li><li>preparations for preventing drying of the skin and for washing, above all creams that provide a short-term protective silicone coating and are applied before contact with water. For washing, it is recommended to use oily products or syndet. Their proper and regular use enables significantly less dehydration of the skin. It has been proven that emollients improve the electrical properties of the stratum corneum, reduce thickening of the skin and symptoms of scaling, and to a certain extent reduce irritation and have anti-inflammatory properties.</li><li>cold cream based on beeswax that creates a thin protective film on the skin and protects it from drying out and cracking. It is especially recommended when staying in the snow and when we are directly exposed to extreme conditions such as cold and wind. In these conditions, it is not recommended to use moisturizing creams because at low temperatures water molecules in them freeze and form sharp crystals that further irritate and damage the skin, leading to cracking and even more drying.</li></ul><p>
It is extremely important to protect the skin from the damaging effects of UV rays. Before going out, you should apply a product with a protective factor. For cloudy days, it is recommended to use a product with spf 15, for sunny days, use a product with spf 30, and for staying in the snow and at a higher altitude, use a product with spf 50.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/skin_protection_in_winter_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="skin_protection_in_winter_alt_alt"/><p>Some skin diseases worsen during winter. For example, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and often acne get worse. People with such changes in the skin during the winter must carry out intensive feeding of the skin with dermocosmetic preparations. It should be emphasized that dryness does not lead to psoriasis, but that with psoriasis the skin is dry and requires intensive care. Normal facial skin must be regularly moisturized on cold days so that it does not become dry. Algae, hyaluronic acid, phospholipids and sphingolipids are excellent skin moisturizers and substances that quickly replace the lack of water. Dry skin is characterized by dryness, flaking and a tendency to itch, and the symptoms worsen in winter. Such skin needs to be cared for with nutritious preparations such as vitamin E, glycerin, fatty acids and urea. For oily skin, it is necessary to choose products that will not clog pores and worsen acne, and that will sufficiently hydrate the skin, which can be very dry due to various treatments.</p><p>In addition to hydration from the outside, the skin needs to be hydrated from the inside as well, in order to provide your body with much-needed hydration. Sufficient intake of vitamin C is recommended. Vitamin C participates in building collagen, the protein responsible for skin elasticity. During the winter months, try to pay attention to your diet. A well-balanced diet, which includes healthy fats, enough protein and lots of fruits and vegetables, is most beneficial to the skin.</p><p>
During the winter, physical activity is also reduced, which stimulates circulation not only in the body, but also in the skin, and in this way the skin gets enough oxygen and removes harmful substances. Increased circulation thus has a favorable effect on the metabolism of skin cells.</p><p>
The skin, as the largest organ of our body, requires special care during the winter, and pharmacists will be happy to help you with their expert advice. Contact us with confidence!</p></div>`

Tests for pregnancy or ovulation, for determining ketones or for determining different types of drugs work on the same principle. The result serves as a guideline for your own safety, as well as any of the previously mentioned types of tests. The COVID tests are therefore not 100 percent reliable and cannot replace available tests in specialized institutions for their performance, but they are a very good indicator of how to act further according to the obtained result. Depending on the result of the test, you should contact your chosen general practitioner for further treatment in case of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p><p>
In general, the COVID test should be used if you already have any of the symptoms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as:</p><ul><li>
elevated body temperature</li><li>
coughing</li><li>fatigue</li><li>loss of sense of taste or smell</li><li>
headaches or others</li></ul><p>
Then his result is almost 100 percent accurate because at that stage of the disease, larger amounts of viruses are already present in the body, and it is almost impossible for the test to show an incorrect result, unless there is an error in one of the production processes. In that case, if you have any of the above symptoms and the test turns out to be negative, contact your general practitioner anyway.</p><p>
In our pharmacies and specialized stores you can find three types of tests, from three different manufacturers, which are approved by HALMED.</p><p>
There are three basic types of COVID tests, i.e. three types of samples, which can be used to determine the presence of infection:</p><ul><li>saliva sample</li><li>
sample of the nasopharynx (the part of the pharynx located behind the nasal cavity)</li><li>nasal sample (front part)</li></ul><p>Saliva and nasal samples can be taken independently at home and do not need to be performed by a trained person, but are designed for use by laypersons. It is only necessary to read in detail the instructions included in the package of the home test. Some manufacturers even have attached pictorial instructions for easier and safer use</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/types_of_home_covid_tests_and_their_uses_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="types_of_home_covid_tests_and_their_uses_alt_alt"/><p>
The Wondfo 2019-NCOV Antigen Test allows sampling through saliva. This type of testing is a slightly less reliable sampling method and gives less precise results compared to nasal samples. Their accuracy is around 94%. The result is already visible after 5 to 10 minutes. How is it used? Open the enclosed ampoule with liquid contents and twice collect saliva in the mouth and drop it into the ampoule. Then close the ampoule and shake and turn several times. After that, squeeze the contents of the ampoule onto the attached test strip and wait 5 to 10 minutes. First the control line appears, and only then the test line that indicates the test result. If it appears, the test is positive.</p><p>
A sample from the nasopharynx can be performed in specialized institutions (hospitals, outpatient clinics, polyclinics and others) provided for this purpose, which are primarily equipped with trained staff and the necessary equipment.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/types_of_home_covid_tests_and_their_uses_alt_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="types_of_home_covid_tests_and_their_uses_alt_alt_alt"/><p>A nasal sample can be taken using the Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test. This test ensures quick and high-quality sampling from the front of the nose, no deeper than 2.5 cm. Also, the reliability of this test is almost 99% accurate, and the result can be read after 20 minutes. You can find more detailed information about this test as well as detailed instructions by clicking on the link. FlowFlex SARS-COV-2 Antigen Rapid Test allows taking a sample from the front of the nose. It is best used within seven days of the onset of symptoms, but people without symptoms can also be tested. The results are visible within 15 to 30 minutes.</p><p>How are they used? Carefully open the attached ampoule with liquid content and squeeze the liquid into the extraction tube. First, insert the soft part of the attached swab stick into one nostril and rotate it three to four times along the mucous membrane. Repeat the same in the other nostril. After that, place the swab in the extraction tube, rotate it three to five times and then let it stand in the tube for one minute. Then press the tube and remove the solution from the swab and drip three drops onto the test strip, which you then leave on a flat, clean surface. After the required time, depending on the test, a control line appears, and only then the test line that indicates the test result. If it appears, the test is positive.</p></div>`

Post-COVID syndrome refers to a group of symptoms that remain present for more than three weeks after the onset of the COVID-19 infection. The incidence of post-COVID syndrome is estimated at 10-35%, while in hospitalized patients it can reach 85%.</p><p>The symptoms vary from those that require a visit to the doctor and further controls, to those that can be self-medicated with the help of a pharmacist, and in the text we will single out the most common ones.</p><h1>Fatigue</h1><p>The most common symptom for which people turn to a pharmacist for help is constant fatigue that is present despite rest and adequate sleep. Fatigue is very common after viral infections, such as COVID, and usually subsides after 2 or 3 weeks. However, in some people it can persist for weeks or months. Fatigue occurs due to the body's continuous response to the virus.</p><p>The key is to stay active, because the energy level in the body increases with activity, eat healthy and reduce stress as much as possible. Adaptogenic plants can help reduce the body's response to stress, the most famous of which are rhodiola and ginseng. Along with an adequate diet, it is advisable to take vitamin-mineral supplements and coenzyme Q10. In addition to being known as the coenzyme of youth, CoQ10 participates in many processes in the body necessary to generate energy, improve memory and increase physical endurance.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/post_covid_syndrome_and_how_to_help_yourself_alt.jpeg" alt="post_covid_syndrome_and_how_to_help_yourself_alt"/><h1>Hair loss</h1><p>An elevated body temperature is a common symptom of COVID-19. Two to three months after infections in which one of the main symptoms was an elevated body temperature, significant hair loss can be observed. Hair loss can last up to nine months. The medical name for this type of hair loss is telogen effluvium, in which more hair enters the telogen (shedding) phase than normal.</p><p>The most important vitamins that can help with hair loss are the B-complex vitamins, among which biotin (B7) stands out. Biotin is also known as vitamin H, after the German Haut und Haare (skin and hair). It works by stimulating the production of keratin, a protein that occurs naturally in hair and nails and is responsible for the structure and quality of hair. Collagen has recently become increasingly popular when talking about the beauty of skin, hair and nails. Type I collagen is the most common type of collagen in the body and it strengthens the hair root.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/post_covid_syndrome_and_how_to_help_yourself_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="post_covid_syndrome_and_how_to_help_yourself_alt_alt"/><h1>Insomnia</h1><p>Post-COVID syndrome includes a number of neurological symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, memory loss and insomnia. Neurological symptoms are very often the result of stress, and the number of people who have developed them has increased significantly since the beginning of the pandemic.</p><p>Melatonin is a hormone that regulates the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness, and which begins to be released more strongly in a dark environment. As a dietary supplement, it is taken in a dose of 1-3 milligrams half an hour to an hour before going to sleep. It is not intended for long-term use, and taking excessive doses can lead to nightmares. Valerian or odolen is the most famous plant that is used to help with insomnia, and it also helps with anxiety and nervousness. It also has a sedative effect. It most often comes in combinations with other medicinal plants such as lemon balm, hops, passionflower, peppermint and yellow poppy. Lemon balm also helps with digestive problems caused by nervousness, hops have a calming and soporific effect, while passionflower will remove anxiety and tension without a sedating effect. Peppermint has a relaxing effect, and California poppy is often combined with other sedative herbs to enhance their effect.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that if post-COVID symptoms persist for a long time, worsen and interfere with daily work and quality of life, it is necessary to visit a doctor. Today, there are post-COVID clinics for people who feel the consequences of the disease in any way in the respiratory (most often), neurological and mental aspects.</p></div>`

Lozenges with antiseptics are intended for adults and children over 6 years of age. They are dissolved in the mouth every 2-3 hours up to the maximum prescribed daily amount of lozenges, depending on the medicine. Sprays for the oral mucosa are more suitable forms for the pediatric population. Benzidam chloride spray has an anti-inflammatory effect and reduces pain and can be used in children over 4 years old.

It is recommended not to consume food and drinks for at least 1 hour after applying the medicine, regardless of the form it is in.</li><li>
Local anesthetic. Some lozenges and sprays contain local anesthetics with additional pain-reducing effects and make swallowing easier. They are intended for children over 6 years old. Medicines of the first three groups are available in pharmacies</li><li>
Sage has anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and astringent effects (tightens tissue). You can apply lozenges, spray or prepare an infusion with sage leaves that is gargled.</li><li>Hyaluronic acid and Icelandic lichen in the form of throat lozenges and sprays coat the mucous membrane of the throat, create a protective film and relieve throat irritation, dryness, hoarseness and difficulty swallowing. Pastilles with Icelandic lichen are intended for adults and children over 4 years old, and those with hyaluronic acid for children over 6 years old.</li><li>Due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effect, propolis is recommended for relieving the symptoms of a sore throat, and is applied in the form of a spray or lozenge.

Ambrosia pollen is considered the strongest natural allergen in our climate and causes major health problems. Allergic rhinitis, so called hay fever is the most common symptom, and is manifested by rhinorrhea (runny nose), difficulty breathing, sneezing, itching and postnasal secretion. Eye symptoms include itching, tearing and redness. The goal of treatment is to enable normal daily functioning (work, school), participation in sports activities, normal sleep and minimization of unpleasant symptoms. Here are 5 ways to achieve this:</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/5_ways_to_reduce_ragweed_allergy_symptoms_alt.jpeg" alt="five_ways_to_reduce_ragweed_allergy_symptoms"/><h1>
Avoiding allergens</h1><p>The highest concentration of pollen in the air is in the morning and early afternoon, and it decreases after rain, so it is recommended to take this into account when planning a trip to nature. It is especially recommended to stay in the mountains above 1000 m where there is no air pollution or the presence of plants. After being outdoors, showering and changing clothes helps to reduce the introduction of pollen into the space where you are staying. In addition, there are foods that cause a similar allergic reaction, so the advice is to avoid watermelons, melons, bananas and zucchini.</p><h1>Rinsing the nose with saline or sea salt solutions</h1><p>Physiological solution and sea salt solution thins the mucus and facilitates the elimination of mucus and allergens from the nose. It is especially recommended to do this before applying therapeutic sprays so that the mucous membrane is clean and free of mucus. Otherwise, by blowing out the accumulated mucus, the applied medicine is also eliminated from the nose.</p><h1>Application of medicines</h1><p>The treatment should start at least two weeks before flowering and continue until the flowering ends. The most commonly used drugs are antihistamines that are available without a prescription. Their application reduces symptoms of itching, sneezing, runny nose and eye symptoms, while nasal congestion is affected by the so-called decongestant drops or sprays, also available without a prescription. Such drops and sprays may be used for a maximum of 5-7 days, because prolonged use leads to damage to the mucous membrane and creates recurrent nasal congestion, which results in the need for constant use of the drug. If a satisfactory effect is not achieved, it is necessary to contact the doctor in order to introduce a stronger anti-inflammatory therapy</p><h1>Using preservative-free artificial tears</h1><p>To reduce unpleasant eye symptoms, it is recommended to wash the eyes with physiological solution, avoid additional irritation by rubbing the eyes, and include artificial tears without preservatives in the therapy, which help wash away allergens from the tear film. Such preparations also help to minimize damage to the surface of the eye that occurs due to the use of antihistamine eye drops with preservatives. In addition, the application of cold compresses can relieve itching and swelling of the eye, and wearing sunglasses can reduce the exposure of the eye to allergens.</p><h1>
Support with herbs and nutritional supplements</h1><p>Black cumin is the most famous herb that relieves allergy symptoms, along with blackcurrant and goat's milk. The flavonoid from onions, quercetin, has also shown a beneficial effect, and there is increasing interest in probiotics that are being tested for these indications.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/5_ways_to_reduce_ragweed_allergy_symptoms_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="five_ways_to_reduce_ragweed_allergy_symptoms_alt_alt"/></div>`

The human immune system consists of cells, tissues and organs that recognize harmful substances and microorganisms in the body and then activate all the necessary mechanisms to remove these substances from the body as quickly as possible without harmful consequences for health.</p><p>
When the immune system is weakened, its functions are impaired and the body has a harder time resisting infections.</p><p>
The most common causes of weakened immunity in adults are:</p><ul><li>improper and irregular diet</li><li>insufficient quality rest and sleep</li><li>lack of physical activity</li><li>stress</li><li>
bad lifestyle habits such as smoking or frequent alcohol consumption</li></ul><p>In kindergarten and school-aged children, the most common cause of frequent infections is the lack of maturity of the immune system, more precisely, the lack of acquired immunity. Namely, the organism creates antibodies only during the first contact with a microorganism. This is precisely why the child's organism cannot adequately defend itself when it first encounters numerous viruses and bacteria, and the disease develops.
As the child grows up, the immune system also develops and the organism becomes more resistant to various disease-causing agents.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/a_strong_immune_system_for_the_health_of_the_body_alt.png" alt="a_strong_immune_system_for_the_health_of_the_body_alt"/><h1>
Important nutrients for a healthy immune system</h1><p>In order to have a beneficial effect on the immune system, it is necessary to ingest certain nutrients important for its proper functioning. Among them, we will highlight three important nutrients that can be used by adults and, in an adjusted dose, by children.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/a_strong_immune_system_for_the_health_of_the_body_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="a_strong_immune_system_for_the_health_of_the_body_alt_alt"/><p>Vitamin C is probably the most frequently mentioned vitamin when it comes to boosting immunity. This important vitamin participates in the stimulation of lymphocytes and phagocytes, white blood cells that participate in protecting the body from infection. Vitamin C also acts as an antioxidant and protects the body from the harmful effects of free radicals.
Foods rich in this vitamin include peppers, kale, broccoli and citrus fruits. Vitamin C is available as a dietary supplement in various forms. You can find it in liquid form, immediate or sustained release tablets, effervescent tablets or chewable tablets. For people prone to irritation of the gastric mucosa, the esterified form of vitamin C is recommended because the pH is neutral and mild for the stomach.</p><p>The role of vitamin D in the growth and development of bones and teeth has been known for many years. In recent times, more and more people are talking about its role in strengthening the body's defense capabilities.
Vitamin D is synthesized in certain quantities in the human body under the influence of UV light. In the colder period of the year, we are less exposed to sunlight, and therefore the synthesis of vitamin D is lower, and it is recommended to take it additionally in the form of food supplements. The need for vitamin D intake depends on the age and the concentration of vitamin D in the blood, that is, the determined risk for the occurrence of vitamin D deficiency.
Foods particularly rich in vitamin D are blue fish, liver and egg yolk, and in food supplements, vitamin D for children is available in the form of drops and sprays, while for adults, in addition to the aforementioned forms, vitamin D can be found on the market in the form of tablets, capsules and ampoule.</p><p>Zinc is an essential mineral that our body cannot produce on its own, but must be taken in through food or in the form of nutritional supplements.
Foods that can serve as a good source of zinc include meat and dairy products, fish, eggs and nuts. In food supplements, zinc is found in combined vitamin-mineral preparations or on its own as zinc gluconate, picolinate or bisglycinate.
The role of zinc in the immune response is participation in the activation of neutrophils and NK (natural killer) cells. In the case of a cold, zinc works by reducing the intensity and shortening the duration of the symptoms.</p><h1>
Natural immunomodulators</h1><p>In periods of increased efforts and during the season of colds and viruses, when we feel that immunity is weakening, natural immunomodulators should be added to important nutrients in order to further strengthen the immune system. From this group of preparations, we will single out three that have been in use for a long time and are considered effective and safe for use in children and adults.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/a_strong_immune_system_for_the_health_of_the_body_alt_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="a_strong_immune_system_for_the_health_of_the_body_alt_alt_alt"/><p>Beta glucan is one of the most commonly used and safest immunomodulators. It can be taken when the symptoms of the disease already appear, but it is even better to start taking it preventively. Its action is fast and intense, and manifests itself through the activation of macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes and NK cells.
Beta glucan, as an independent preparation or in combination with vitamin C and zinc, can be found in the form of syrup, tablets or capsules. It is used in children and adults for the prevention of bacterial, viral or fungal infections. The effectiveness of beta-glucan has been confirmed by numerous studies, especially in the prevention and treatment of diseases of the upper respiratory tract.</p><p>The medicinal properties of Echinacea were known to the Indian tribes of North America. Today, it is most often used as an excellent immunomodulator.
When choosing a preparation containing Echinacea, it is important to pay attention to the exact species that is in the preparation. Namely, only Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea pallida have a beneficial effect on immunity. Also, the fresh plant has a many times higher concentration of active substances than the dried one, and this should also be taken into account when choosing a preparation.
Food supplements containing Echinacea are most often in the form of tinctures or syrups, but you can also find tablets or capsules. They are most often used for 2 weeks continuously, after which it is advisable to take a break. In some cases, Echinacea can be used for several weeks continuously, but in no case longer than 8 weeks.</p><p>Propolis is a resinous substance that bees collect from plant sources, and it has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and immunomodulatory effects.
Propolis available in the form of drops can be an alcoholic extract, intended for use in adults, or non-alcoholic (water), intended for children. In both cases, it is important that the product is purified and standardized for the composition of flavonoids.
Propolis is also applied locally, for inflammatory processes in the throat and nose. Propolis-based throat sprays also come in two forms, alcoholic and non-alcoholic, depending on whether they are intended for adults or children. They work by soothing an irritated throat, making swallowing easier and relieving pain.</p></div>`

The nasal mucosa warms and moistens the air we breathe, enables us to sense the sense of smell, protects our lower respiratory tract from the penetration of harmful factors from the air. Namely, with the air we breathe, numerous particles enter our nasal mucosa that can be infectious, allergenic or irritating, and the contact of such particles with the nasal mucosa will trigger a reaction of the nasal immune system. A healthy nasal mucosa is responsible for retaining, filtering and expelling such potentially harmful substances.</p><p>During the colder period of the year, autumn and winter, we often encounter two equally unpleasant problems when breathing through the nose - a dry mucous membrane and an excessively moist mucous membrane. Dryness is most often caused by staying indoors, while excessive moisture of the mucous membrane occurs when staying outdoors.</p><p>
More frequent stay in closed heated spaces where there is a lack of moisture in the air can dry out the nasal mucosa and make it a more favorable environment for the settlement of microorganisms</p><p>Staying outdoors and inhaling cold air results in swelling of the nasal mucosa with increased secretion of mucus, which ultimately leads to nasal congestion and difficulty breathing.</p><h1>
Daily hygiene and moistening of the nasal mucosa</h1><p>Daily care for the health of the nasal mucosa is extremely important for the health of the entire organism. Primarily, emphasis should be placed on the hygiene of the nasal cavity, which, in addition to cleaning, also maintains the humidity of the nasal mucosa so that all its functions are maintained. Seawater-based nasal sprays are optimal for such frequent use.</p><p>Isotonic sprays can be used daily for nasal hygiene. In them, the salt concentration is aligned with the natural level in the epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa and will not cause the mucosa to dry out.
Such sprays may also contain additional ingredients such as panthenol or Aloe vera that coat and nourish the nasal mucosa and have a soothing effect if the mucous membrane is dry and irritated.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/how_to_keep_the_nasal_mucosa_passable_and_optimally_moist_alt.jpeg" alt="how_to_keep_the_nasal_mucosa_passable_and_optimally_moist_alt"/><p>In addition to nasal sprays, nasal ointments that contain active ingredients for the care and regeneration of the nasal mucosa, such as d-panthenol and vitamins A and E, also have an extremely beneficial effect on the mucous membrane. Nasal ointments can also be used daily. We especially feel their beneficial effects in winter, when the nasal mucosa is often exposed to cold outside air or overheated and dried air in closed spaces.</p><h1>
Stuffed nose</h1><p>A stuffy nose and difficulty breathing make it difficult for us to function on a daily basis primarily by disrupting sleep and preventing quality rest. There are several potential causes of nasal congestion, starting from a little longer stay in the cold air to allergies, colds and viruses.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/how_to_keep_the_nasal_mucosa_passable_and_optimally_moist_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="how_to_keep_the_nasal_mucosa_passable_and_optimally_moist_alt_alt"/><p>When the nose is blocked, it is recommended to use hypertonic sprays with sea water that contain a higher concentration of salt than those for everyday hygiene.
Hypertonic solutions work by reducing mucosal swelling and normalizing mucus secretion, which ultimately leads to improved nasal patency. When panthenol or Aloe vera for the care and renewal of the nasal mucosa and ingredients such as eucalyptus, which has a refreshing effect, are added to hypertonic solutions, the feeling of comfort when breathing is further improved.</p><p>If used with conventional nasal decongestants such as xylometazoline, oxymetazoline or naphazoline, which reduce the swelling of the nasal mucosa by vasoconstriction, hypertonic nasal sprays will improve their effect and reduce the frequency and duration of their use.
Hypertonic nasal solutions are suitable for use in children older than 6 years and adults, even those in whom the use of conventional decongestants is contraindicated, such as people with elevated blood pressure.</p><h1>
Respiratory health care</h1><p>We can further contribute to the health of our respiratory system by applying essential oils that we can, together with water, disperse in the room using an aroma diffuser. In this way, the effect of humidifying the air is achieved, which ultimately prevents the nasal mucosa from drying out, and at the same time, the space we are in is filled with pleasant scents of essential oils.</p><p>Spraying essential oils in the space also creates an unfavorable environment for harmful microorganisms in the air, because most essential oils have antibacterial and/or antiviral effects. In the period of the year when respiratory infections are more frequent, it is advisable to choose essential oils such as tea tree, ravintsara or eucalyptus for your aroma diffuser, because they, in addition to creating a fragrant atmosphere in the home ideal for relaxation, also have a beneficial effect on the health and patency of the respiratory tract.</p></div>`

Water is a key element in the development of mosquitoes because the females lay eggs on the surface of the water or on plants near the water's edge, from which new individuals develop after 7 to 10 days. This is precisely why staying in shady areas (for example in forests) and near stagnant water guarantees numerous "encounters" with mosquitoes. Before laying eggs, the female needs a blood meal, during which she sucks the host's blood, and at the same time releases her secretions into his bloodstream, which are responsible for the reaction to the sting.
In our region, there are usually more mosquitoes in the period from June to September. They are most active at the beginning and end of the day, at dawn and dusk.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/mosquito_bites_how_to_prevent_and_treat_them_alt.jpeg" alt="mosquito_bites_how_to_prevent_and_treat_them_alt"/><h1>
Prevention of mosquito bites</h1><p>Different people react differently to mosquito bites. Reactions vary from barely noticeable to very pronounced skin reactions such as severe itching, redness and swelling. More serious systemic reactions to mosquito bites such as nausea, dizziness and fever are very rare. Mosquitoes are dangerous carriers of various diseases in some parts of the world, but fortunately, this is not common in our region.
Regardless of their intensity, the consequences of mosquito bites are mostly unpleasant and it is best to avoid them, if possible. The basic protection measures include: avoiding wetter areas in nature where mosquitoes breed intensively, wearing clothes with long sleeves and long legs, and using repellants.</p><p>
Repellents are agents that are sprayed in the area or applied directly to the skin and/or clothes, and act to repel mosquitoes and thus prevent their bites. The most important criteria when choosing a suitable repellent are its safety, effectiveness and long-term protection it provides.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/mosquito_bites_how_to_prevent_and_treat_them_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="mosquito_bites_how_to_prevent_and_treat_them_alt_alt"/><p>One of the most well-known repellents is DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide), which is found in many products to protect against insect bites and provides effective and long-lasting protection against mosquitoes, ticks, fleas and flies. Preparations that contain picaridin as an active substance also protect against the same insects. Picaridin has been observed to provide somewhat more effective protection as it keeps mosquitoes at a greater distance. In general, it has been shown that in people who use products containing DEET, mosquitoes still come into contact with the skin, but no bites occur, while when using picaridin, mosquitoes do not land on the skin at all.</p><p>Some natural preparations have also proven to be effective in protecting against mosquito bites, primarily among them the essential oil of lemon eucalyptus (Corymbia citriodora) and the essential oil of citronella, which is obtained from plants of the lemon grass family (Cymbopogon nardus and Cymbopogon winterianus). Preparations that contain a mixture of essential oils from plants such as lyceum (Litsea cubeba), cajeput (Melalueca cajuputi) and lavender (Lavandula angustifolia and Lavandula spica) also show excellent repellent action.</p><p>
Products to protect against mosquito bites come in different forms, they can be sprays, lotions, roll-ons and bracelets. They differ in the number and concentration of active ingredients, so the duration of their effect is also different. The effect can last from 30 minutes up to 8 hours, and after this period it is necessary to reapply the product.</p><p>There are preparations on the market that contain types and concentrations of repellents adapted exclusively for adults, as well as preparations suitable for the protection of children and the protection of the whole family (children and adults).
When choosing products to protect children from mosquito bites, we always take their harmlessness as the first criterion. In many countries of the world, DEET and picaridin are considered safe for use in children as early as three months of age, but Croatian regulations are somewhat stricter and most repellents on our market are labeled as suitable for children older than 2 years. Eucalyptus oil should not be used in children under 3 years of age. Regardless of the choice of product, it is important to note that when applying it, it is advised to avoid the child's hands in order to avoid contact of the protective agent with the child's mouth or eyes after application.</p><p>In order to reduce the number of mosquitoes in the area where you are staying, aroma diffusers can help, in which you can drip the already mentioned essential oils with a repellent effect, such as the essential oil of citronella, lemon eucalyptus, lavender or cajeput, which will make the air in your home less attractive to mosquitoes.</p><h1>
After a mosquito bite</h1><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/mosquito_bites_how_to_prevent_and_treat_them_alt_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="mosquito_bites_how_to_prevent_and_treat_them_alt_alt_alt"/><p>f a mosquito bite does occur, there are preparations that help alleviate the symptoms of redness, swelling and, especially unpleasant, itching. The choice of preparation depends on the strength of the reaction to the sting.
For milder reactions, it is usually enough to cool the injection site and apply a cream, gel or lotion with soothing ingredients from plants such as chamomile, calendula or Aloe vera. In the case of a more pronounced reaction to the sting, preparations for local application at the site of the sting can be used, the active components of which are antihistamines (available over the counter) or corticosteroids (available only with a doctor's prescription). If the reaction is extremely strong and unpleasant, oral antihistamines are used in the form of syrup for children or tablets for adults. Such therapy is very often prescribed by a doctor, but some antihistamines, such as loratadine in packages with a smaller number of tablets, are also available without a prescription. Regardless of their milder dispensing regime, we definitely advise you to make a decision about their use only after consulting your pharmacist.</p></div>`

The virus that causes COVID-19 was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and is the originator of a pandemic that has now globally led to significant changes in the way of life in all countries of the world. Croatia was not immune to these changes either.</p><p>The most common symptoms of the disease are fever, dry cough and fatigue. Some sufferers may experience other symptoms such as sore throat, diarrhea, stuffy nose or muscle pain. Symptoms usually start as mild, but their intensity can increase depending on the progress of the disease. Approximately 20% of patients with COVID-19 develop more severe symptoms, while the rest of patients mostly develop mild symptoms that do not require hospital treatment. The risk group of patients includes the elderly and people who already suffer from diseases such as cancer, diabetes and diseases of the cardiovascular or respiratory system. However, younger people and people who were completely healthy before contracting the coronavirus can develop more serious symptoms of the disease. It is important to point out that even if a person has no symptoms, he can be a carrier of the disease. Regardless of age, people who have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing should definitely contact a doctor.</p><h1>
Hand and surface hygiene, protective equipment</h1><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/covid_19_prevention_is_key_alt.jpeg" alt="covid_19_prevention_is_key_alt"/><p>We can get infected with the coronavirus if we are in close contact with an infected person. The disease spreads from person to person through droplets, when an infected person talks, coughs or rains. Droplets with the virus can remain on objects and surfaces such as doorknobs or fences, so a person can become infected if he touches such surfaces and then touches his nose, mouth or eyes with his hands. It is for these reasons that hand hygiene and face protection with a mask are extremely important.</p><p>Hand hygiene is primarily maintained by washing hands with warm water and soap. Although it sounds simple, there are also rules for washing hands that should be followed in order to achieve the best possible effect. We should wash our hands for at least 20 to 30 seconds in the following way:</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/covid_19_prevention_is_key_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="covid_19_prevention_is_key_alt_alt"/><p>During our stay outside the house, we should definitely have an antiseptic for the skin so that we can disinfect our hands after touching objects and surfaces in the places where we stayed, as well as after our hands were in contact with money.
Antiseptics work by penetrating the cell of the microorganism and inactivating it. Different types of hand antiseptics are available on the market, they usually come in the form of solutions, gels, sprays and wet wipes. Their active substances are most often chlorhexidine and ethanol in combination with other compounds of similar effect. They are applied to the skin of the hands and rubbed into the palms, wrists and between the fingers until the skin is completely dry (approximately 30 seconds).</p><p>In addition to their beneficial effect, soaps and antiseptics can damage the hydrolipidic layer of the skin and then the skin becomes dry, sensitive, and eventually damaged. Therefore, it is extremely important to adequately care for the skin. We recommend the use of quality, dermatologically tested hand creams that contain ingredients that nourish the skin, restore its protective layer, have an anti-inflammatory and regenerative effect, such as dexpanthenol, allantoin, vegetable butters (e.g. shea butter) and vegetable oils (e.g. jojoba oil or argan oil).</p><p>It is important to disinfect surfaces with which you are in daily contact, such as the steering wheel and gearbox of the car, doorknobs and floors in the apartment. In such cases, it is recommended to use a surface disinfectant. They also contain microbicidal substances, but usually in a slightly higher concentration than products intended for skin disinfection.</p><p>
During a stay outside the home, in places where it is not possible to reflect the recommended distance, such as shops or for example public transport, it is recommended to wear a mask in order to prevent exposure of others to the droplets of the person wearing the mask, to prevent touching the face with hands and due to the possible positive effect on raising awareness about health responsible behavior.</p><p>
Masks differ in the degree of protection they provide, so we arrive at the basic division into:</p><ul><li>masks made of fabric (most often cotton)</li><li>medical (surgical)</li><li>filtering masks</li></ul><p>
Masks made of fabric are intended for personal use and mainly serve to avoid touching the face with hands. To a minimal extent, they protect against the exposure of others to the droplets of the person wearing the mask. When wearing them, it is still necessary to maintain the prescribed distance. After each wearing, it is recommended to wash the mask at a minimum temperature of 60 °C.</p><p>Surgical masks are intended for one-time use and primarily protect against the exposure of others to the droplets of the person wearing the mask. However, they also protect the person wearing the mask from droplets from people in the environment and from the transfer of microorganisms from the hands to the face.</p><p>Filtering masks are disposable and are used to protect employees of healthcare institutions from particles, droplets and aerosols. If they have a valve, they only filter inhaled air and protect the wearer. Masks without valves filter both inhaled and exhaled air and protect both the person wearing it and the people with whom he is in contact.</p><h1>Strengthen immunity</h1><p>In addition to all the above protection measures, it is extremely important to act protectively from the inside and strengthen the body's immune system. In addition to adjusting your lifestyle so that you ensure enough sleep and rest every day and a quality diet that includes plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, you can also strengthen your immunity with various food supplements that contain immunostimulants. These are substances that enhance the body's immune response by increasing the number of immune cells, accelerating their mobility or facilitating antigen recognition. For this purpose, preparations prepared from different plant species and active substances isolated from natural products, as well as vitamins and minerals, are mostly used.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/covid_19_prevention_is_key_alt_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="covid_19_prevention_is_key_alt_alt_alt"/><p>Beta-glucan as an independent preparation, or with the addition of vitamin C and zinc, is one of the most commonly used immunostimulants. Its action is fast and intense. It increases phagocytosis and concentrations of enzymes that serve as messengers in the immune response and is therefore considered effective in various infections (bacterial, viral, fungal). Beta-glucan is a polysaccharide obtained by isolation from the walls of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, some mushrooms (shiitake, maitake) and cereals, such as barley and oats.
The effectiveness of beta-glucan has been confirmed by numerous studies, especially in the prevention and treatment of diseases of the upper respiratory tract. Since it is a powerful immunostimulant, it should be used judiciously. Beta glucan is considered a safe and non-toxic molecule even if taken in very high doses and over a long period of time. It is intended for children older than one year and adults.</p><p>
Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that protects cells from oxidative stress caused by free radicals. Given that it participates in the synthesis of collagen, vitamin C helps maintain the health of the skin so that it can maintain its barrier function and protect against the penetration of external harmful factors into the body. It acts on cells of the immune system by increasing phagocytosis and the activity of lymphocytes. It also reduces fatigue and exhaustion.</p><p>Vitamin D is extremely important for the function of the immune system, it has anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties and improves the activity of cells of the immune system. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases, which suggests that taking dietary supplements containing it could have a beneficial effect in protecting against respiratory infections. But it is important to keep in mind that one should not overdo the intake of vitamin D, as excessive consumption can have toxic effects.</p><p>Zinc is a mineral that is a common ingredient in various nutritional supplements to improve the function of the immune system, but it can also be taken on its own. In addition to the preventive effect, zinc can have a positive effect if it is taken during an infection and shorten its duration and severity of symptoms.</p><p>
Propolis is a resinous substance that bees collect from plant sources. It contains vitamins and minerals, of which vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, C and E, as well as iron, zinc and flavonoids in larger quantities. Propolis flavonoids act as powerful antioxidants and protect cells from oxidative stress caused by the action of free radicals, thus reducing the development of inflammatory processes.</p><p>Royal jelly is a secretion from the glands of worker bees. It has been proven that its regular intake significantly supports human health and longevity. In addition to having a high nutritional value, royal jelly also contains peptides with a strong antioxidant effect, which protects against the harmful effects of free radicals and is therefore recommended for people with impaired immunity.</p><p>Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea) is a plant native to North America known for its stimulating effect on the immune system. Research has shown its particularly beneficial effect in viral infections. In addition to having a preventive effect, Echinacea also shortens their duration if an infection does occur. Due to its strong immunostimulating effect, it is not recommended to take it for longer than 6 to 8 weeks continuously. For the same reason, preparations containing Echinacea should not be taken by people with autoimmune diseases.</p><h1>
Additional measures</h1><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a lot of talk about the importance of maintaining the moisture of the mucous membranes of the respiratory system. Namely, the dried mucous membrane is much more susceptible to the penetration of pathogens.
The humidity of the nasal mucosa can be maintained with seawater-based sprays. It is recommended to use them on a daily basis for the care and cleaning of the nose.</p><p>The humidity of the mucous membranes of the respiratory system can be favorably affected by the use of air humidifiers or aroma diffusers in the rooms of the apartment. In addition to humidifying the air, aroma diffusers have the option of adding essential oils. We recommend choosing essential oils such as tea tree, ravintsara or eucalyptus radiata, which will improve the smell in the room, as well as the air quality.</p><p>
There are many measures and procedures you can take to protect yourself and your loved ones during this pandemic. Strengthen your immunity, take care of hygiene, use protective equipment and keep your distance. Behave responsibly.</p></div>`

Numerous positive effects of exposure to the sun are known, such as a better mood and the synthesis of vitamin D in our body. Likewise, in recent years, there has been an increasing awareness of the need for increased care of our skin before, during and after exposure to the sun.",

Although there is no life without the sun, it should be remembered that the sun, or the UV radiation it emits, is one of the biggest enemies of the skin. Excessive exposure of the skin to the sun promotes the formation of harmful free radicals. They visibly damage the skin tissue, which is manifested by the appearance of wrinkles, dark spots and burns. But what is even more worrying is the internal damage that increases the risk of skin cancer.</p><p>Sun allergy more often affects middle-aged women and is more common in fair-skinned people. It most often appears on the face and décolleté in the form of small itchy pimples. Once it occurs, in most people it recurs every year. Patients with autoimmune diseases, kidney diseases, and people on tetracycline antibiotic therapy are additionally at risk from sun allergies.</p><p>With proper and timely skin preparation, it is possible to minimize the harmful effects of exposure to UV rays without fear of health consequences. Numerous studies show that dietary supplements can be of great importance in protecting the skin, and it is recommended to start taking them at least 4-6 weeks before intensive exposure of the skin to the sun.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/preparing_the_skin_for_the_sun_alt.jpeg" alt="preparing_skin_for_the_sun_alt"/><p>Correctly dosed combinations of certain antioxidants such as beta-carotene, astaxanthin, lycopene, zeaxanthin, group B vitamins, selenium and zinc, as well as ingredients such as green tea, pycnogenol, genistein and omega-3 fatty acids, can certainly contribute to the photoprotective capacity of the organism. In modern photoprotective preparations, you can also find ingredients with added value - vitamin C and derivatives, vitamin E, resveratrol, anthocyanidins from rose hips, polyphenols from the cocoa tree, lutein, cotton, Chilean raspberry, Chilean hazelnut and many others.</p><p>Carotenoids are plant compounds with strong antioxidant activity responsible for the orange, yellow and red color of fruits and vegetables. Here, beta-carotene stands out, which has a protective effect against acute and chronic skin damage caused by sun exposure. Lutein, which plays an important role in protecting the delicate structure of the retina of the eye, should be highlighted among the carotenoids. Namely, the eyes are, along with the skin, the most sensitive organ when it comes to the sun's rays. Lutein acts as a sunlight filter by absorbing dangerous UV rays. In order to achieve a protective effect, it is necessary to take carotenoids at least 10 weeks before sun exposure. So, right now is the right time to start taking care of the upcoming summer months.</p><p>Astaxanthin is a carotenoid that, unlike the others, is not metabolized in the body into vitamin A, which makes its use very safe. Its antioxidant capacity is 10 times stronger than other carotenoids and even 550 times stronger than vitamin E. Small differences in structure improve its chemical properties. This is precisely what enables it to cross the blood-brain barrier and has a strong antioxidant effect in the central nervous system (especially in the macula of the eye and in Alzheimer's disease). In nature, we find it in different organisms: shrimp, crabs and lobsters, and salmon. The best natural source of astaxanthin is the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis. It is mostly used for antioxidant protection of the skin from harmful solar radiation and for skin hypersensitivity to the sun. Regular use of astaxanthin during sun exposure reduces the possibility of burns, sun allergies, spots and vitiligo. In addition to effectively protecting, it also contributes to a more even tanning of the skin. To ensure its protective effect, it is recommended to take it for 4 to 12 weeks at a dose of 4 to 8 mg. In addition to food supplements, there are also very innovative cosmetic products with astaxanthin.</p><p>Quality fatty acids present in unrefined evening primrose, borage, hemp (GLA), flax, walnut, wild rose (ALA-omega 3) and blue fish and algae oils (EPA, DHA-omega 3) are very important factors for skin health.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/preparing_the_skin_for_the_sun_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="prepare_skin_for_the_sun_alt_alt"/><p>One of the most significant new dermatological discoveries is the discovery of vitamin C's ability to "oppose" the negative consequences of sun exposure. Accumulated free radicals cause significant tissue damage, especially collagen and elastin, the building blocks of the skin, causing, for example, a loss of skin firmness and the formation of wrinkles. Vitamin C, as a powerful antioxidant, neutralizes free radicals and thus prevents damage to the skin. In addition to preventing damage, vitamin C plays an important role in the regeneration of already damaged skin by stimulating collagen synthesis.</p><p>Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that promotes the repair of damage caused by free radicals and has a beneficial effect on all skin types. It also helps to reduce skin redness after excessive exposure to the sun and reduces the formation of wrinkles and keeps the skin smooth for a long time.</p><p>Vitamin A is found in the skin in small concentrations, but it is absolutely essential for skin health. In addition to having a key role in the growth and development of skin cells, it has been proven to promote the repair of damage caused by UV rays. Excessive exposure to the sun can cause the destruction of vitamin A in the skin, as a result of which vitamin A deficiency can develop. Then, as a result, dark spots, wrinkles, skin peeling and, in the worst case, precancerous lesions appear.</p><p>
Vitamin A, C and E complement each other in their action. Therefore, for optimal protection from the sun, it is best to use a food supplement that provides adequate amounts of all three vitamins.</p><p>Due to its powerful antioxidant properties, selenium is believed to play a key role in the prevention of skin cancer. According to some information, if you spend too much time in the sun, selenium will reduce the risk of skin redness and burns. However, it should be kept in mind that selenium is toxic in high doses, so for a positive effect it is necessary to stick to the recommended amounts.</p><p>Zinc plays an important role in repairing damage to the skin. Taken through dietary supplements, it can lead to more effective recovery from burns, eczema and rashes. Zinc also has a strong effect on strengthening the immune system, which is put to the test in the summer due to the exhausting rays of the sun. Zinc preserves the health of the eyes exposed to the sun's rays, but also of the skin, which often becomes dry and gray in the summer. Zinc achieves a particularly beneficial effect in combination with copper, an essential component of melanin, the natural pigment in hair.</p><p>Vitamins of the B group are necessary for maintaining healthy skin, hair and nails. They, with protein as a support, will help the skin to remain brighter and more elastic, the nails to be stronger and the hair to be softer and silkier. Studies have shown that as many as 40% of dermatitis cases are the result of insufficient intake of vitamins of the B group through food.</p><p>
Three to five cups a day of high-quality green tea will reduce skin itching during allergic reactions, protect you from free radicals and repair skin damaged by exposure to the sun.</p><p>Considering that you need to start taking all the nutritional supplements we talk about in this blog at least a few weeks before intense exposure to the sun, make sure you start preparing your skin on time. Even with good preparation, in the summer months it will be extremely important to protect the skin with preparations for a protective factor, which you will soon be able to find out more about in our blog on skin protection when exposed to the sun.</p></div>`

                subContent: `<div class="blog-wrapper"><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/seasonal_allergies.webp" alt="seasonal_allergies"/><p>Even when allergens are present in a small concentration, the immune system of an allergic person will react violently as if it were an infection and try to protect the body from substances that are otherwise not harmful to it. This is how allergy symptoms appear. In addition to allergies whose symptoms are present throughout the year, such as allergies to certain food ingredients, house dust or the hair of some animals, a particularly large number of people are affected by allergies whose symptoms are most intense in the warmer part of the year. Spring, summer and early autumn are the periods in which the struggle with unpleasant symptoms can be particularly demanding for people prone to pollen allergies and sun allergies (photodermatoses).</p><h1>Pollen allergies</h1><p>Pollen allergy is a hypersensitivity reaction of the body to pollen grains. Pollen is produced in spring, summer and autumn when plants bloom intensively. Most of the pollen is carried by the wind and after inhaling the grains in the body of hypersensitive people, it triggers a series of allergic reactions. Grass, weed and tree pollen has the greatest allergenic potential – the ability to cause allergy symptoms in hypersensitive people even at lower concentrations. Propensity to allergies can be conditioned by genetic factors, but it also depends on conditions and lifestyle. Namely, people who live in urban areas are more likely to develop an allergy due to air pollution and lifestyle.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/seasonal_allergies_alt.jpeg" alt="seasonal_allergies_alt"/><p>Seasonal allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, is an allergic inflammation of the nasal mucosa caused by an allergen and is one of the most common forms of allergy.
Respiratory allergy symptoms are generally similar to a cold. They include watery nasal discharge, sneezing, nasal obstruction and itching, and irritation, itching and watering of the eyes. Apart from the causative agent, an allergic disease is distinguished from a cold by a strong itching of the nose, palate, eyes, throat and ears. People with allergic rhinitis may develop comorbidities such as asthma, sinusitis, ear infections, lower respiratory tract infections, nasal polyposis, and sleep disorders.</p><p>Pollen allergies are seasonal in nature and symptoms appear occasionally, in a certain part of the year, during the flowering period of some types of trees, grasses and weeds. Symptoms of occasional allergic rhinitis are usually more violent than permanent (year-round) allergic rhinitis. In terms of intensity, they range from mild to moderately severe. If the symptoms are mild, daily activities, work ability or school obligations are not disturbed and sleep is normal. Moderately severe symptoms include one or more disturbances related to sleep, daily activities, and disturbances related to work or school. Of all the symptoms, the sleep disorder is most affected by a stuffy nose.</p><h1>Treatment of pollen allergies</h1><p>
The treatment of pollen allergies is divided into three parts:</p><ul><li>
avoiding allergens</li><li>
pharmacotherapy</li><li>
immunotherapy</li></ul><p>With external allergens, it is necessary to take care of the concentration of pollen in the air (follow the pollen calendar and forecasts). It is also advised to avoid being outdoors, especially in areas of lush vegetation, on days when this concentration is elevated. On days of high concentration of allergens, windows should be kept closed and aired only late at night, and laundry drying should be avoided outdoors. It is recommended to wear protective masks in order to reduce the inhalation of allergens as much as possible. Wearing glasses, sunglasses or diopters, reduces the contact of allergens with the eyes. Contact lens users are recommended to wear one-day lenses. Before going to bed, it is recommended to take a shower and wash your hair in order to remove allergens from your skin and hair.</p><p>As avoiding allergens is completely impossible, pharmacotherapy is needed. There are over-the-counter antihistamines on the market, which are used for self-medication. When choosing an antihistamine, the advice of a pharmacist is very important. In milder forms of the disease, antihistamines are used in the form of tablets for adults or syrup for children. The more severe form of the disease, in addition to antihistamines, requires the use of nasal (nasal) corticosteroid sprays and inhalers. Decongestant drops for the nose may be used continuously for 5 to 7 days. In the case of their long-term use, dependence on such preparations often develops, which leads to chronic damage to the nasal mucosa. The therapy must be carried out in accordance with the instructions of the doctor and pharmacist.</p><p>A number of other over-the-counter preparations help significantly alleviate allergy symptoms. These are primarily nasal sprays and eye drops, but also food supplements containing ingredients such as black cumin oil, goat's milk oil, quercetin or calcium and vitamin C, the use of which has shown beneficial effects on allergic symptoms.</p><p>
Rinsing the nose with saline solution, using nasal sprays containing sea water or sea water with the addition of ectoine, and nasal ointments that prevent allergens from entering the respiratory system can help in the treatment. Physiological solution and products with sea water help in daily nasal hygiene, keep the mucous membrane moist and remove impurities and allergens.</p><p>Ectoin creates a protective film on the nasal mucosa that prevents the contact of allergens with the cells of the mucosa and thus alleviates the allergic reaction, and at the same time allows the allergens to be removed more easily by blowing the nose. In combination with sea water, ectoine is applied for the care and protection of the mucosal epithelium. Ectoin is found in preparations for the care and protection of the nose and in eye drops intended for people prone to allergies.</p><p>Black cumin oil (Nigella sativa) is obtained by cold pressing the seeds, and contains numerous phytonutrients, essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins.
The active ingredients of black cumin oil, especially thymoquinone, act as natural immunomodulators. These are substances that regulate and balance the work of the immune system, which is manifested, among other things, by mitigating the body's overreaction to allergens.
People prone to pollen allergies are advised to start consuming black cumin oil one to two months before the expected onset of the first symptoms. The timely start of taking this oil will prevent the appearance of unpleasant allergy symptoms or at least reduce their intensity.
Due to better absorption, as well as a specific taste, it is recommended to consume it after a meal. The taste can be softened by mixing black cumin oil with juice or honey.
In addition to liquid form, black cumin oil is also available in capsules.</p><p>Goat's milkweed (Astragalus membranaceus) has a positive effect on alleviating allergy symptoms. Kozlinac belongs to adaptogenic plants, which means, among other things, that it has the role of normalizing the organism, i.e. correcting disorders caused by stressful conditions and agents.
In order to show its positive effects, products containing goat's milk should be started to be used at least one month before the expected allergy season and continue to be used throughout the season.</p><p>Quercetin is a bioflavonoid from fruits and vegetables. In addition to acting as an antioxidant, quercetin is considered one of the most powerful natural antihistamines. The result of its effect on reducing the release of histamine is to alleviate the intensity of the symptoms of seasonal allergies. Due to their synergistic effect, quercetin is most often combined with vitamin C in preparations.</p><p>Allergy symptoms can be alleviated by taking preparations containing calcium and vitamin C. Calcium alleviates the allergic reaction by reducing capillary permeability. Vitamin C effectively reduces the level of histamine that the body produces during an allergic reaction, which causes symptoms such as sneezing, watery eyes and nasal congestion.</p><p>It is recommended to start taking a daily dose of 800 to 1300 mg of calcium at the first symptoms of allergy. The dose is gradually reduced as symptoms improve. Vitamin C is recommended to be taken in a dose of 1000 to 1500 mg per day, preferably in forms that are less harmful to the stomach lining, and are gradually released throughout the day.</p><p>The third therapeutic option is immunotherapy or hyposensitization. The latest findings indicate that it is a very successful procedure for the treatment of all allergic diseases. It is performed by continuously exposing the patient to increasing doses of a certain allergen.</p><p>Pollen allergic diseases are on the rise. Adhering to prevention measures, monitoring the pollen forecast, regular and correct use of medications prescribed by a doctor, and consulting a pharmacist about the preparations that are available for prevention or supplementing pharmacotherapy can significantly reduce the symptoms of the disease and improve the quality of life.</p><h1>
Allergies to the sun</h1><p>Exposure to the sun's rays has an extremely beneficial effect on our mood. Unfortunately, this joy can be disturbed by the appearance of unwanted reactions on the skin when in contact with UV radiation. In addition to burns, which are the result of staying in the sun for too long without adequate protection, other reactions such as redness, pimples and itching can appear on the skin, which are symptoms of photodermatosis.</p><p>Photodermatoses, which are most commonly encountered under the common name of sun allergies, are skin disorders caused by exposure to UV radiation. They can be primary and secondary. In primary photodermatoses (solar dermatitis), skin damage is caused by the action of UV radiation itself. In the case of secondary photodermatoses (phototoxic and photoallergic dermatoses) in addition to UV rays, the presence of photosensitive substances is also required.</p><h1>Primary photodermatoses</h1><p>It is believed that primary photodermatoses are caused by the reaction of the own immune system, which recognizes some parts of the sun-exposed skin as foreign. Then it triggers an allergic reaction, which is manifested by symptoms such as redness, pimples and even pustules, often accompanied by itching. Symptoms most often appear one or two days after exposure to the sun, most often affect the lower part of the arms and chest, and less often the face. They most often appear in the spring when the skin is exposed to direct sunlight for the first time after it has been covered by clothes for a long time. Repeated sun exposure can worsen symptoms and make the reaction likely to recur every year.</p><p>In order to reduce the possibility of an unwanted skin reaction to UV radiation, it is necessary to behave responsibly in the sun. It is advised to avoid exposure to the sun during the period of the day when UV radiation is most intense and to protect the skin with clothing. It is recommended to choose high-quality preparations for protecting the skin from the sun from the outside and food supplements that will have a protective effect on the skin[I1] from the inside. The intake of antioxidants and specific nutrients that contribute to the healthy appearance of the skin, prevent premature aging and reduce damage caused by exposure to the sun is important. The beneficial effects of beta-carotene, astaxanthin, selenium, zinc and vitamins A, C and E in preparing the skin for sun exposure are known. Find out more about these nutrients in nutritional supplements in our blog on preparing the skin for the sun.</p><img src="http://localhost:9000/images/blogs/seasonal_solutions/seasonal_allergies_alt_alt.jpeg" alt="seasonal_allergies_alt_alt"/><h1>
Secondary photodermatoze</h1><p>Some autoimmune diseases (primarily systemic lupus erythematosus and porphyria), as well as certain drugs and cosmetic products, can also make the skin hypersensitive to sunlight, and then we are talking about secondary photodermatoses. Therefore, at the first appearance of a reaction to the sun, it is necessary to check whether the person has been prescribed any new pharmacotherapy or perhaps started using a new cosmetic product that could lead to such a reaction. Substances that reduce the sensitivity threshold of our skin to the sun's rays and cause a strong reaction after only a short exposure are called photosensitizing substances.</p><p>Photosensitizing drugs include, among others:</p><ul><li>some antibiotics (tetracycline, fluoroquinolone)</li><li>antihistamines</li><li>some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</li><li>drugs for acne therapy (primarily retinoids)</li><li>
some medicines with an effect on the central nervous system (medicines against tension, nervousness and feelings of anxiety)</li><li>tricyclic antidepressants</li><li>
antimycotics</li><li>oral contraceptives</li></ul><p>Secondary photodermatoses can occur as a reaction to some of the ingredients in products such as hair dyes, anti-dandruff shampoos, soaps, perfumes, deodorants and even some sun protection products that, in combination with exposure to UV radiation, cause an allergic reaction. Therefore, when choosing such products, it is important to always give preference to dermatologically tested preparations available in pharmacies. Such sunscreen products are generally hypoallergenic, contain fewer or no preservatives and fragrances, and generally contain ingredients that should be well tolerated by even the most sensitive skin.</p><p>
If an allergic reaction occurs as a result of using a product containing a photosensitizing substance, it is necessary to stop using that product immediately</p><p>
Sun allergy symptoms, in addition to medications prescribed by a doctor, can be alleviated by cold compresses and the application of soothing lotions such as after-sun skin care lotions.</p></div>`
